Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

I just lost around 90k of my hard earned money on this scam.\\n\\nUpdate on 9th Nov 2021\\nAfter a long conversation with Amazon support agent, I was able to connect to the support number published by Fujitsu. Looks like the message we hear when the line is busy is misleading. Once the call got through to Fujitsu support, things were pretty smooth. Support is handled by Lenovo India support team and the response was superb. The service personnel patiently attended to all the issues. Some driver updates here and there resolved the issue for a while. It reappeared again after a week. But luckily by that time Windows 11 update became available for the model.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now.

There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle.

It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received.

The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price.

You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6.. Takes thin and light to the next level.. Have owned 2 Zenbooks before, this is lighter and with better build quality.. Hoping they do a good job on service as well..', \"I brought this Laptop 3 days back. Excellent product. Typical Japanese Design with Simplicity. The most advantage is you have full connectivity. You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

Tried all the software and driver reinstallation instructions available online with no success. Tried contacting the customer care number and got a message that the number or service doesn't exist. Called the local customer service point listed in Fujitsu site. Even that number is fake or incorrect. Looks like it is a scam. Product quality is pathetic. Speaker sounds like the one we get in local chor bazars. Kindly note that return and refund option is not available. You might get the same sub par product as a replacement even if you raise a complaint. Kindly avoid this product at any cost. I just lost around 90k of my hard earned money on this scam.\\n\\nUpdate on 9th Nov 2021\\nAfter a long conversation with Amazon support agent, I was able to connect to the support number published by Fujitsu. Looks like the message we hear when the line is busy is misleading. Once the call got through to Fujitsu support, things were pretty smooth. Support is handled by Lenovo India support team and the response was superb. The service personnel patiently attended to all the issues. Some driver updates here and there resolved the issue for a while. It reappeared again after a week. But luckily by that time Windows 11 update became available for the model. I upgraded successfully to Windows 11 and both Wifi and Bluetooth is working now. But not sure if the issue will pop up again after a while. Fingers crossed.\", 'Play Video\\n Help please.\\nI am not gettibg this ( yahoo mail) on full screen\\nRight click does not operate', 'Everything is good but its only 1.9GHZ not as mentioned in description 3.9GHZ overall budget best product best specs all rounder, perfomance is absolutely good, it came with ms office, getting i7 at this price is great deal', \"Writing this review after using it for 2 months. I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX. Its like playing on a GT 750 which is still better than not having a GPU in this chip shortage.\\n\\nIt comes with Intel NVMe which is almost twice faster than ordinary SSDs. Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time.

Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.\\n\\nLow sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.\", \"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop. This is a real bummer, the thunderbolt port also doesny charge the laptop.\\n\\nThe webcam and the speakers are also totally useless. So a video call was a disspointing experience.\\n\\nAnd the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me. All mi support could do was redirect me to a youtube video and microsoft directly. I wasn't able to work around the error msg: office home and student is not associated to your account.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

Hoping they do a good job on service as well..', \"I brought this Laptop 3 days back. Excellent product. Typical Japanese Design with Simplicity. The most advantage is you have full connectivity. You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

Tried all the software and driver reinstallation instructions available online with no success. Tried contacting the customer care number and got a message that the number or service doesn't exist. Called the local customer service point listed in Fujitsu site. Even that number is fake or incorrect. Looks like it is a scam. Product quality is pathetic. Speaker sounds like the one we get in local chor bazars. Kindly note that return and refund option is not available. You might get the same sub par product as a replacement even if you raise a complaint. Kindly avoid this product at any cost. I just lost around 90k of my hard earned money on this scam.\\n\\nUpdate on 9th Nov 2021\\nAfter a long conversation with Amazon support agent, I was able to connect to the support number published by Fujitsu. Looks like the message we hear when the line is busy is misleading. Once the call got through to Fujitsu support, things were pretty smooth. Support is handled by Lenovo India support team and the response was superb. The service personnel patiently attended to all the issues. Some driver updates here and there resolved the issue for a while. It reappeared again after a week. But luckily by that time Windows 11 update became available for the model. I upgraded successfully to Windows 11 and both Wifi and Bluetooth is working now. But not sure if the issue will pop up again after a while.

I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX. Its like playing on a GT 750 which is still better than not having a GPU in this chip shortage.\\n\\nIt comes with Intel NVMe which is almost twice faster than ordinary SSDs. Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours.

Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed.

Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol.

And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch. Only display didn't reach the expectation.\", \"Best possible clone of MacBook in your budget.\\n\\nI tried to install MacOS and shared this photo with my friends and they thought it was MacBook 😂\\nPros -\\n1) Metal build\\n2) Battery backup (my case 6-7hrs)\\n3) Display quality with 90hz performs really well for editing\\n4) Wi-Fi 6 has great connectivity and has thunderbolt 4 port\\n\\nCons-\\n1) It would be great if it come with Ryzen variant and 2gb graphics card\\n2) Intel iris xe donot performs well in high end games (tried watch dogs2)\\n3) the velcro for binding the charger wire is little small and can have problem while binding the wires\\n\\nOverall it is a good clone for MacBook which comes in a pocket. But there are some concerns about the after sale services..... Let's see it how it happens in upcoming days 😊\", 'I bought this on 8th Sep. The laptop is good and definitely value for money.\\nBut there was no Mi extended warranty option when you buy from Amazon. I wrote to Amazon and the response was to contact in case I do not get any response by 17th. But on 18th the option of chat contact was also closed (return window closed on 17th, - I did not understand the connection as the question is not about return)nor did I get any response through email. It is cheating as you pay the same price for curtailed benefits but you are not told of this upfront. This leaves bad tase in the whole buying experience. For the first time I am unhappy with both Amazon and Xiaomi.', \" Display is crisp and clear\\nPerformance is good too\\nDrives are good too\\nFingerprint is awesome\\nFront cam is above average (good)\\nBuild quality is premiuim (macbook feel)\\n\\nBut Xiaomi lacked few things which I noticed\\n\\nThere's no OEM Windows disk included or atleast they should attach a link on their website where all drivers are available.\\n\\nThere's no support assist app which can help in installation of drivers, like dell have dell assist and every other brands have that.\\n\\nSpeaker quality is good but it's not loud unless you turn off DTS processing app.\\n\\nExternal graphics card is supported thanks to Thunderbolt 4 but there should have one more option with discrete graphics card for civil and mechanical engineers.\\n\\nThis pc can handle casual gaming but for heavy gaming it should not be your first choice.\", 'Display: Awesome\\nLook and in hand feel: Awesome\\nBattery: Getting just 4 hrs backup :(\\nSpeaker: The only main drawback, disappointed.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

I just lost around 90k of my hard earned money on this scam.\\n\\nUpdate on 9th Nov 2021\\nAfter a long conversation with Amazon support agent, I was able to connect to the support number published by Fujitsu. Looks like the message we hear when the line is busy is misleading. Once the call got through to Fujitsu support, things were pretty smooth. Support is handled by Lenovo India support team and the response was superb. The service personnel patiently attended to all the issues. Some driver updates here and there resolved the issue for a while. It reappeared again after a week. But luckily by that time Windows 11 update became available for the model.

The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX.

Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup.

Mac speakers are definitely good, but with a price tag.\\n\\nOverall: Value for money.\\n\\nYet to test:\\n1) Battery.\\n2) Performance.', \"Thanks to livetre.com who's reviewing this laptop right now. Like many already pointed out the volume is very low when you get the laptop and also the keyboard backlight goes off after every 15 sec if not touched.? But there's a fix\\n\\nIn the windows start search 'dts' and open the app called dts audio processing and choose the Game Mode t0 get loud sound.\\n\\nAnd for the keyboard backlight to get always on, Restart and press F2 to enter in to bios. look for keyboard backlight power and set to standard mode instead of power save mode for backlight.\\n\\nonly downside of this laptop is the trackpad click. Due to large trackpad the clicks feels stiff and weird.\", \"Updated Review after 5 months use:\\n1.initially felt like volume is very low, but didn't fave any issues for Teams, webex and Zoom meetings.\\n2. Charger is not working from last one week, as of now using the office lenovo laptop charger.\\n3. Some times felt trackpad is stuck after restart it will work fine.\\n4. Build Quality and keys are strong enough.\\n5. Mainly we can go for this laptop just for Display itself.\\n6. No issues still now in performance wise even I use many applications related to coding.\\n\\nOld Review:\\nExcellent laptop for productivity purpose and watching movies( with external speakers 🔊).\\nDisplay is awesome and Laptop feels very premium. Finger print unlock is very fast and Accurate. Superb build quality.Trackpad is also good,\\nDidn't check the games yet will update the review after one month of use.\\nProgramming purpose this is the best Laptop with good display.\\nBooting is very fast and it will open the screen in 5sec with finger print access.\\n\\nCons which I feel\\n1.even though it is 15 inch lap it doesn't have number keys at right side of the keyboard.\\n2.Volume of the speakers is very less for spending 77k.\\n3. Camera quality is not good.\\n4. Seems Xiaomi compromised on Charger , quality is ok don't know about the durability and also on charger it shows other brand name\", \"No slim book with 16 GB ram, 3.2k display and an aluminum chassis at this price. Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.\\n\\nLow sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.\", \"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop. This is a real bummer, the thunderbolt port also doesny charge the laptop.\\n\\nThe webcam and the speakers are also totally useless. So a video call was a disspointing experience.\\n\\nAnd the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me. All mi support could do was redirect me to a youtube video and microsoft directly. I wasn't able to work around the error msg: office home and student is not associated to your account. Hope it works for others.\\n\\nHappy with the build quality, display, wifi 6 and fast ports.\\nRest all is just gimick unless some miraculous software update can fix the speakers, webcam and charging options.\", \"Pros\\n\\nGreat price to value proposition. Similar spec laptops cost twice as much from established brands.\\n\\nBeautiful 15.6 inch anti glare 16:10 aspect ratio matte screen. 16:10 ratio helps to see more lines in excel/word documents compared to 16:9 aspect ratio. But 16:9 seems more suited for viewing videos since no horizontal black bars at the top and bottom of screen.\\n\\nElegant looks in full metallic body. Grey colour variant looks stunning. Like an affordable windows macbook. Solid built with no flex in the laptop body.\\n\\nThunderbolt 4 port for versatile connectivity. Connect 2 4k monitors simultaneously from same thunderbolt port. Thunderbolt is exclusive to 11th gen Intel core i5/i7 and not available yet in AMD ryzen 7 series processors.\\n\\nCharge through either thunderbolt port or type c port\\n\\nMacro key which can be used to quick launch an app like chrome by drag and drop of app into the macro key input area.\\n\\nBattery charge indicator with 3 colours. Red for charge less than 20, orange from 20 to 90 and green for charge more than 90 percentage.\\n\\n90hz display with 3k resolution. Scrolling very smooth. fn+s key to switch between 60hz and 90hz refresh rate\\n\\nCore i7 11th gen processor - breeze through normal workloads. Haven't heard the cooling fans kicking in yet.\\n\\n512gb nvme ssd for speedy launch of programming ide like pycharm.\\n\\n16gb ram - most of the time 8 gb free\\n\\nIntel iris graphics - haven't tried any games yet but 4k YouTube videos are smooth.\\n\\nWifi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1 for reliable connectivity.\\n\\n65w usb type c charger - full charge in 90 mins.\\nCan use 65w mobile phone charger to charge this laptop.\\n\\nFingerprint sensor and power button combined.\\n\\nGood loud speakers after enabling games mode on inbuilt dts app and turning on Equalizer.\\n\\nLifetime validity Office 2019 included - get ready to work on excel Power point etc without spending additional for Microsoft office software. Activation also easy by giving personal email while launcing office app first time.\\n\\nSoft relatively silent keys with good travel and 2 levels of backlight for working at night. Comfortable to type for long.\\n\\nUsable 720p camera for zoom/teams call. Disable digital video stabilization setting from camera app else there will be delay in video.\\n\\nClose to 10 hour battery backup after full charge. Battery drain also reasonable under normal workloads. Battery stand by good.\\n\\nLarge trackpad which is good and supports gestures like gentle single tap for left click, gentle tap with 2 fingers together for double click which removes need for press/click of trackpad. Configure touchpad options for better results.\\n\\nGood palm rejection and comfortable edges while typing on keyboard.\\n\\nHinge closes in a smooth pleasant manner with enough cushioning\\n\\nHassle free exchange by Amazon for 7 year old base model macbook air.\\nNo cost emi for 3 months\\n\\nWhat could have been improved to make this laptop even better:\\n\\nMi 67w sonic charger which has a slim profile should have been provided instead of the rather uninspiring default legacy kind of looking LITEON company charger.\\n\\nSmall size of shift key on right takes time to get used to. Could have been a normal size shift key.\\n\\nNo dedicated sd card slot to quickly transfer photos from SLR to laptop. Have to rely on usb cables.\\n\\nNo dedicated number keys even though laptop is a 15.6 inch one. Would have been better to have dedicated number keys while working on excel.\\n\\nVoice capture using inbuilt microphone not the loudest. Use a wired or wireless headphone for voice capture.\\n\\nA bit on heavier side while picking up.May be due to the grade 6 sandblasted aluminium used.\\n\\nBacklight doesn't stay on. Goes off after sometime of inactivity and has to be renabled. But it seems there is an option in bios to keep it on the whole time once selected.\\n\\nDefault sound output from speakers not loud enough. Only once games mode is selected and equalizer is enabled from inbuilt dts app does the sound output cross 80 decibel.\", \"We'll crafted, light weight laptop with top notch internals. Value for money at this price range compared to other exclusive laptop brands .\", \"If productivity is your main agenda in a windows package, then it really doesn't get better than this. The value this laptop provides is unmatched in the market , especially the display which is going to leave your breathless. This is pure windows in a good hardware package by Xiaomi.

Buy it without a second thought.\", 'Read above rating as 4.5/5.\\n\\nUpgraded from an era old Hp Laptop. Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol. Another example after the iPhone 11 that proves higher resolution != better display.\\n\\nI have an old hp pavilion 14 x360 (14inch 1080p), LG 22MK600M monitor (22 inch IPS LCD 1080p), Lenovo L24i-30 monitor (24 inch IPS LCD 1080p) to compare with and have to say color reproduction is not at all natural on the Mi laptop. And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch. Only display didn't reach the expectation.\", \"Best possible clone of MacBook in your budget.\\n\\nI tried to install MacOS and shared this photo with my friends and they thought it was MacBook 😂\\nPros -\\n1) Metal build\\n2) Battery backup (my case 6-7hrs)\\n3) Display quality with 90hz performs really well for editing\\n4) Wi-Fi 6 has great connectivity and has thunderbolt 4 port\\n\\nCons-\\n1) It would be great if it come with Ryzen variant and 2gb graphics card\\n2) Intel iris xe donot performs well in high end games (tried watch dogs2)\\n3) the velcro for binding the charger wire is little small and can have problem while binding the wires\\n\\nOverall it is a good clone for MacBook which comes in a pocket. But there are some concerns about the after sale services..... Let's see it how it happens in upcoming days 😊\", 'I bought this on 8th Sep. The laptop is good and definitely value for money.\\nBut there was no Mi extended warranty option when you buy from Amazon. I wrote to Amazon and the response was to contact in case I do not get any response by 17th. But on 18th the option of chat contact was also closed (return window closed on 17th, - I did not understand the connection as the question is not about return)nor did I get any response through email. It is cheating as you pay the same price for curtailed benefits but you are not told of this upfront. This leaves bad tase in the whole buying experience. For the first time I am unhappy with both Amazon and Xiaomi.', \" Display is crisp and clear\\nPerformance is good too\\nDrives are good too\\nFingerprint is awesome\\nFront cam is above average (good)\\nBuild quality is premiuim (macbook feel)\\n\\nBut Xiaomi lacked few things which I noticed\\n\\nThere's no OEM Windows disk included or atleast they should attach a link on their website where all drivers are available.\\n\\nThere's no support assist app which can help in installation of drivers, like dell have dell assist and every other brands have that.\\n\\nSpeaker quality is good but it's not loud unless you turn off DTS processing app.\\n\\nExternal graphics card is supported thanks to Thunderbolt 4 but there should have one more option with discrete graphics card for civil and mechanical engineers.\\n\\nThis pc can handle casual gaming but for heavy gaming it should not be your first choice.\", 'Display: Awesome\\nLook and in hand feel: Awesome\\nBattery: Getting just 4 hrs backup :(\\nSpeaker: The only main drawback, disappointed.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

Some driver updates here and there resolved the issue for a while. It reappeared again after a week. But luckily by that time Windows 11 update became available for the model.

The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX.

NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor.

For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM).

The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed.

Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol.

And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch. Only display didn't reach the expectation.\", \"Best possible clone of MacBook in your budget.\\n\\nI tried to install MacOS and shared this photo with my friends and they thought it was MacBook 😂\\nPros -\\n1) Metal build\\n2) Battery backup (my case 6-7hrs)\\n3) Display quality with 90hz performs really well for editing\\n4) Wi-Fi 6 has great connectivity and has thunderbolt 4 port\\n\\nCons-\\n1) It would be great if it come with Ryzen variant and 2gb graphics card\\n2) Intel iris xe donot performs well in high end games (tried watch dogs2)\\n3) the velcro for binding the charger wire is little small and can have problem while binding the wires\\n\\nOverall it is a good clone for MacBook which comes in a pocket.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now.

It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM).

Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.\\n\\nLow sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.\", \"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol.

And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch.

The laptop is good and definitely value for money.\\nBut there was no Mi extended warranty option when you buy from Amazon. I wrote to Amazon and the response was to contact in case I do not get any response by 17th. But on 18th the option of chat contact was also closed (return window closed on 17th, - I did not understand the connection as the question is not about return)nor did I get any response through email.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

Called the local customer service point listed in Fujitsu site. Even that number is fake or incorrect. Looks like it is a scam. Product quality is pathetic. Speaker sounds like the one we get in local chor bazars. Kindly note that return and refund option is not available. You might get the same sub par product as a replacement even if you raise a complaint. Kindly avoid this product at any cost. I just lost around 90k of my hard earned money on this scam.\\n\\nUpdate on 9th Nov 2021\\nAfter a long conversation with Amazon support agent, I was able to connect to the support number published by Fujitsu. Looks like the message we hear when the line is busy is misleading. Once the call got through to Fujitsu support, things were pretty smooth. Support is handled by Lenovo India support team and the response was superb. The service personnel patiently attended to all the issues. Some driver updates here and there resolved the issue for a while. It reappeared again after a week. But luckily by that time Windows 11 update became available for the model. I upgraded successfully to Windows 11 and both Wifi and Bluetooth is working now. But not sure if the issue will pop up again after a while. Fingers crossed.\", 'Play Video\\n Help please.\\nI am not gettibg this ( yahoo mail) on full screen\\nRight click does not operate', 'Everything is good but its only 1.9GHZ not as mentioned in description 3.9GHZ overall budget best product best specs all rounder, perfomance is absolutely good, it came with ms office, getting i7 at this price is great deal', \"Writing this review after using it for 2 months. I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX. Its like playing on a GT 750 which is still better than not having a GPU in this chip shortage.\\n\\nIt comes with Intel NVMe which is almost twice faster than ordinary SSDs. Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time.

Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.\\n\\nLow sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.\", \"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop. This is a real bummer, the thunderbolt port also doesny charge the laptop.\\n\\nThe webcam and the speakers are also totally useless. So a video call was a disspointing experience.\\n\\nAnd the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me. All mi support could do was redirect me to a youtube video and microsoft directly. I wasn't able to work around the error msg: office home and student is not associated to your account.

Disable digital video stabilization setting from camera app else there will be delay in video.\\n\\nClose to 10 hour battery backup after full charge. Battery drain also reasonable under normal workloads. Battery stand by good.\\n\\nLarge trackpad which is good and supports gestures like gentle single tap for left click, gentle tap with 2 fingers together for double click which removes need for press/click of trackpad.

Could have been a normal size shift key.\\n\\nNo dedicated sd card slot to quickly transfer photos from SLR to laptop. Have to rely on usb cables.\\n\\nNo dedicated number keys even though laptop is a 15.6 inch one. Would have been better to have dedicated number keys while working on excel.\\n\\nVoice capture using inbuilt microphone not the loudest. Use a wired or wireless headphone for voice capture.\\n\\nA bit on heavier side while picking up.May be due to the grade 6 sandblasted aluminium used.\\n\\nBacklight doesn't stay on. Goes off after sometime of inactivity and has to be renabled. But it seems there is an option in bios to keep it on the whole time once selected.\\n\\nDefault sound output from speakers not loud enough. Only once games mode is selected and equalizer is enabled from inbuilt dts app does the sound output cross 80 decibel.\", \"We'll crafted, light weight laptop with top notch internals.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol.

And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now.

The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price.

Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body.

Its like playing on a GT 750 which is still better than not having a GPU in this chip shortage.\\n\\nIt comes with Intel NVMe which is almost twice faster than ordinary SSDs. Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time. This product is excellent and meet my expectation. Good value for money. Slim, easy to use and many features available.', 'Pros- Nice look, i7 at this price, value for money.

Camera quality is not good.\\n4. Seems Xiaomi compromised on Charger , quality is ok don't know about the durability and also on charger it shows other brand name\", \"No slim book with 16 GB ram, 3.2k display and an aluminum chassis at this price. Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.\\n\\nLow sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.\", \"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop. This is a real bummer, the thunderbolt port also doesny charge the laptop.\\n\\nThe webcam and the speakers are also totally useless. So a video call was a disspointing experience.\\n\\nAnd the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me. All mi support could do was redirect me to a youtube video and microsoft directly. I wasn't able to work around the error msg: office home and student is not associated to your account. Hope it works for others.\\n\\nHappy with the build quality, display, wifi 6 and fast ports.\\nRest all is just gimick unless some miraculous software update can fix the speakers, webcam and charging options.\", \"Pros\\n\\nGreat price to value proposition. Similar spec laptops cost twice as much from established brands.\\n\\nBeautiful 15.6 inch anti glare 16:10 aspect ratio matte screen. 16:10 ratio helps to see more lines in excel/word documents compared to 16:9 aspect ratio.

Activation also easy by giving personal email while launcing office app first time.\\n\\nSoft relatively silent keys with good travel and 2 levels of backlight for working at night. Comfortable to type for long.\\n\\nUsable 720p camera for zoom/teams call. Disable digital video stabilization setting from camera app else there will be delay in video.\\n\\nClose to 10 hour battery backup after full charge. Battery drain also reasonable under normal workloads. Battery stand by good.\\n\\nLarge trackpad which is good and supports gestures like gentle single tap for left click, gentle tap with 2 fingers together for double click which removes need for press/click of trackpad.

Could have been a normal size shift key.\\n\\nNo dedicated sd card slot to quickly transfer photos from SLR to laptop. Have to rely on usb cables.\\n\\nNo dedicated number keys even though laptop is a 15.6 inch one. Would have been better to have dedicated number keys while working on excel.\\n\\nVoice capture using inbuilt microphone not the loudest. Use a wired or wireless headphone for voice capture.\\n\\nA bit on heavier side while picking up.May be due to the grade 6 sandblasted aluminium used.\\n\\nBacklight doesn't stay on. Goes off after sometime of inactivity and has to be renabled. But it seems there is an option in bios to keep it on the whole time once selected.\\n\\nDefault sound output from speakers not loud enough. Only once games mode is selected and equalizer is enabled from inbuilt dts app does the sound output cross 80 decibel.\", \"We'll crafted, light weight laptop with top notch internals. Value for money at this price range compared to other exclusive laptop brands .\", \"If productivity is your main agenda in a windows package, then it really doesn't get better than this.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol. Another example after the iPhone 11 that proves higher resolution != better display.\\n\\nI have an old hp pavilion 14 x360 (14inch 1080p), LG 22MK600M monitor (22 inch IPS LCD 1080p), Lenovo L24i-30 monitor (24 inch IPS LCD 1080p) to compare with and have to say color reproduction is not at all natural on the Mi laptop. And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch.

Don't buy this, all the great specs are useless if it doesn't start!\\n\\nUpdate 13/09: I gave it for service and they are saying the battery and motherboard is defective and they need to replace it! I'm shocked. It's a brand new laptop and in 10 days the battery and motherboard is gone? How can that happen? I've hardly even used it! And they also say that since it's a new laptop the parts are taking time to come to the service center! Better to buy a reliable HP, Dell, Lenovo laptop even if it's a bit more expensive!\\n\\nUpdate 20/09: It has been with Mi service center for 8 days now. Everytime I call them they say it will get fixed in 2 days. On probing further they said there is a hardware problem. The battery and motherboard needs to be replaced! Wow I can't understand how the battery and motherboard can have problems in just 10 days of purchase? It's clearly a manufacturing defect from Xiaomi.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time. This product is excellent and meet my expectation. Good value for money. Slim, easy to use and many features available.', 'Pros- Nice look, i7 at this price, value for money.

Like many already pointed out the volume is very low when you get the laptop and also the keyboard backlight goes off after every 15 sec if not touched.?

Camera quality is not good.\\n4. Seems Xiaomi compromised on Charger , quality is ok don't know about the durability and also on charger it shows other brand name\", \"No slim book with 16 GB ram, 3.2k display and an aluminum chassis at this price. Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.\\n\\nLow sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.\", \"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop. This is a real bummer, the thunderbolt port also doesny charge the laptop.\\n\\nThe webcam and the speakers are also totally useless. So a video call was a disspointing experience.\\n\\nAnd the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me. All mi support could do was redirect me to a youtube video and microsoft directly. I wasn't able to work around the error msg: office home and student is not associated to your account. Hope it works for others.\\n\\nHappy with the build quality, display, wifi 6 and fast ports.\\nRest all is just gimick unless some miraculous software update can fix the speakers, webcam and charging options.\", \"Pros\\n\\nGreat price to value proposition. Similar spec laptops cost twice as much from established brands.\\n\\nBeautiful 15.6 inch anti glare 16:10 aspect ratio matte screen. 16:10 ratio helps to see more lines in excel/word documents compared to 16:9 aspect ratio.

Activation also easy by giving personal email while launcing office app first time.\\n\\nSoft relatively silent keys with good travel and 2 levels of backlight for working at night. Comfortable to type for long.\\n\\nUsable 720p camera for zoom/teams call. Disable digital video stabilization setting from camera app else there will be delay in video.\\n\\nClose to 10 hour battery backup after full charge. Battery drain also reasonable under normal workloads. Battery stand by good.\\n\\nLarge trackpad which is good and supports gestures like gentle single tap for left click, gentle tap with 2 fingers together for double click which removes need for press/click of trackpad. Configure touchpad options for better results.\\n\\nGood palm rejection and comfortable edges while typing on keyboard.\\n\\nHinge closes in a smooth pleasant manner with enough cushioning\\n\\nHassle free exchange by Amazon for 7 year old base model macbook air.\\nNo cost emi for 3 months\\n\\nWhat could have been improved to make this laptop even better:\\n\\nMi 67w sonic charger which has a slim profile should have been provided instead of the rather uninspiring default legacy kind of looking LITEON company charger.\\n\\nSmall size of shift key on right takes time to get used to. Could have been a normal size shift key.\\n\\nNo dedicated sd card slot to quickly transfer photos from SLR to laptop. Have to rely on usb cables.\\n\\nNo dedicated number keys even though laptop is a 15.6 inch one. Would have been better to have dedicated number keys while working on excel.\\n\\nVoice capture using inbuilt microphone not the loudest. Use a wired or wireless headphone for voice capture.\\n\\nA bit on heavier side while picking up.May be due to the grade 6 sandblasted aluminium used.\\n\\nBacklight doesn't stay on. Goes off after sometime of inactivity and has to be renabled. But it seems there is an option in bios to keep it on the whole time once selected.\\n\\nDefault sound output from speakers not loud enough. Only once games mode is selected and equalizer is enabled from inbuilt dts app does the sound output cross 80 decibel.\", \"We'll crafted, light weight laptop with top notch internals. Value for money at this price range compared to other exclusive laptop brands .\", \"If productivity is your main agenda in a windows package, then it really doesn't get better than this.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol. Another example after the iPhone 11 that proves higher resolution != better display.\\n\\nI have an old hp pavilion 14 x360 (14inch 1080p), LG 22MK600M monitor (22 inch IPS LCD 1080p), Lenovo L24i-30 monitor (24 inch IPS LCD 1080p) to compare with and have to say color reproduction is not at all natural on the Mi laptop. And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch.

And they also say that since it's a new laptop the parts are taking time to come to the service center! Better to buy a reliable HP, Dell, Lenovo laptop even if it's a bit more expensive!\\n\\nUpdate 20/09: It has been with Mi service center for 8 days now. Everytime I call them they say it will get fixed in 2 days. On probing further they said there is a hardware problem. The battery and motherboard needs to be replaced! Wow I can't understand how the battery and motherboard can have problems in just 10 days of purchase? It's clearly a manufacturing defect from Xiaomi.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

Like many already pointed out the volume is very low when you get the laptop and also the keyboard backlight goes off after every 15 sec if not touched.? But there's a fix\\n\\nIn the windows start search 'dts' and open the app called dts audio processing and choose the Game Mode t0 get loud sound.\\n\\nAnd for the keyboard backlight to get always on, Restart and press F2 to enter in to bios. look for keyboard backlight power and set to standard mode instead of power save mode for backlight.\\n\\nonly downside of this laptop is the trackpad click.

Camera quality is not good.\\n4. Seems Xiaomi compromised on Charger , quality is ok don't know about the durability and also on charger it shows other brand name\", \"No slim book with 16 GB ram, 3.2k display and an aluminum chassis at this price. Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.\\n\\nLow sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.\", \"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop. This is a real bummer, the thunderbolt port also doesny charge the laptop.\\n\\nThe webcam and the speakers are also totally useless. So a video call was a disspointing experience.\\n\\nAnd the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me. All mi support could do was redirect me to a youtube video and microsoft directly. I wasn't able to work around the error msg: office home and student is not associated to your account. Hope it works for others.\\n\\nHappy with the build quality, display, wifi 6 and fast ports.\\nRest all is just gimick unless some miraculous software update can fix the speakers, webcam and charging options.\", \"Pros\\n\\nGreat price to value proposition. Similar spec laptops cost twice as much from established brands.\\n\\nBeautiful 15.6 inch anti glare 16:10 aspect ratio matte screen. 16:10 ratio helps to see more lines in excel/word documents compared to 16:9 aspect ratio.

Like an affordable windows macbook. Solid built with no flex in the laptop body.\\n\\nThunderbolt 4 port for versatile connectivity. Connect 2 4k monitors simultaneously from same thunderbolt port. Thunderbolt is exclusive to 11th gen Intel core i5/i7 and not available yet in AMD ryzen 7 series processors.\\n\\nCharge through either thunderbolt port or type c port\\n\\nMacro key which can be used to quick launch an app like chrome by drag and drop of app into the macro key input area.\\n\\nBattery charge indicator with 3 colours. Red for charge less than 20, orange from 20 to 90 and green for charge more than 90 percentage.\\n\\n90hz display with 3k resolution.

Activation also easy by giving personal email while launcing office app first time.\\n\\nSoft relatively silent keys with good travel and 2 levels of backlight for working at night. Comfortable to type for long.\\n\\nUsable 720p camera for zoom/teams call. Disable digital video stabilization setting from camera app else there will be delay in video.\\n\\nClose to 10 hour battery backup after full charge. Battery drain also reasonable under normal workloads. Battery stand by good.\\n\\nLarge trackpad which is good and supports gestures like gentle single tap for left click, gentle tap with 2 fingers together for double click which removes need for press/click of trackpad. Configure touchpad options for better results.\\n\\nGood palm rejection and comfortable edges while typing on keyboard.\\n\\nHinge closes in a smooth pleasant manner with enough cushioning\\n\\nHassle free exchange by Amazon for 7 year old base model macbook air.\\nNo cost emi for 3 months\\n\\nWhat could have been improved to make this laptop even better:\\n\\nMi 67w sonic charger which has a slim profile should have been provided instead of the rather uninspiring default legacy kind of looking LITEON company charger.\\n\\nSmall size of shift key on right takes time to get used to. Could have been a normal size shift key.\\n\\nNo dedicated sd card slot to quickly transfer photos from SLR to laptop. Have to rely on usb cables.\\n\\nNo dedicated number keys even though laptop is a 15.6 inch one. Would have been better to have dedicated number keys while working on excel.\\n\\nVoice capture using inbuilt microphone not the loudest. Use a wired or wireless headphone for voice capture.\\n\\nA bit on heavier side while picking up.May be due to the grade 6 sandblasted aluminium used.\\n\\nBacklight doesn't stay on. Goes off after sometime of inactivity and has to be renabled. But it seems there is an option in bios to keep it on the whole time once selected.\\n\\nDefault sound output from speakers not loud enough. Only once games mode is selected and equalizer is enabled from inbuilt dts app does the sound output cross 80 decibel.\", \"We'll crafted, light weight laptop with top notch internals. Value for money at this price range compared to other exclusive laptop brands .\", \"If productivity is your main agenda in a windows package, then it really doesn't get better than this.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol. Another example after the iPhone 11 that proves higher resolution != better display.\\n\\nI have an old hp pavilion 14 x360 (14inch 1080p), LG 22MK600M monitor (22 inch IPS LCD 1080p), Lenovo L24i-30 monitor (24 inch IPS LCD 1080p) to compare with and have to say color reproduction is not at all natural on the Mi laptop. And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch. Only display didn't reach the expectation.\", \"Best possible clone of MacBook in your budget.\\n\\nI tried to install MacOS and shared this photo with my friends and they thought it was MacBook 😂\\nPros -\\n1) Metal build\\n2) Battery backup (my case 6-7hrs)\\n3) Display quality with 90hz performs really well for editing\\n4) Wi-Fi 6 has great connectivity and has thunderbolt 4 port\\n\\nCons-\\n1) It would be great if it come with Ryzen variant and 2gb graphics card\\n2) Intel iris xe donot performs well in high end games (tried watch dogs2)\\n3) the velcro for binding the charger wire is little small and can have problem while binding the wires\\n\\nOverall it is a good clone for MacBook which comes in a pocket.

And they also say that since it's a new laptop the parts are taking time to come to the service center! Better to buy a reliable HP, Dell, Lenovo laptop even if it's a bit more expensive!\\n\\nUpdate 20/09: It has been with Mi service center for 8 days now. Everytime I call them they say it will get fixed in 2 days. On probing further they said there is a hardware problem. The battery and motherboard needs to be replaced! Wow I can't understand how the battery and motherboard can have problems in just 10 days of purchase? It's clearly a manufacturing defect from Xiaomi.

Don't trust Xiaomi from now.\\n\\n23/09: They called me from the service center and asked me to collect a replacement laptop.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

Like many already pointed out the volume is very low when you get the laptop and also the keyboard backlight goes off after every 15 sec if not touched.? But there's a fix\\n\\nIn the windows start search 'dts' and open the app called dts audio processing and choose the Game Mode t0 get loud sound.\\n\\nAnd for the keyboard backlight to get always on, Restart and press F2 to enter in to bios. look for keyboard backlight power and set to standard mode instead of power save mode for backlight.\\n\\nonly downside of this laptop is the trackpad click. Due to large trackpad the clicks feels stiff and weird.\", \"Updated Review after 5 months use:\\n1.initially felt like volume is very low, but didn't fave any issues for Teams, webex and Zoom meetings.\\n2.

Camera quality is not good.\\n4. Seems Xiaomi compromised on Charger , quality is ok don't know about the durability and also on charger it shows other brand name\", \"No slim book with 16 GB ram, 3.2k display and an aluminum chassis at this price. Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.\\n\\nLow sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.\", \"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop. This is a real bummer, the thunderbolt port also doesny charge the laptop.\\n\\nThe webcam and the speakers are also totally useless. So a video call was a disspointing experience.\\n\\nAnd the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me. All mi support could do was redirect me to a youtube video and microsoft directly. I wasn't able to work around the error msg: office home and student is not associated to your account. Hope it works for others.\\n\\nHappy with the build quality, display, wifi 6 and fast ports.\\nRest all is just gimick unless some miraculous software update can fix the speakers, webcam and charging options.\", \"Pros\\n\\nGreat price to value proposition. Similar spec laptops cost twice as much from established brands.\\n\\nBeautiful 15.6 inch anti glare 16:10 aspect ratio matte screen. 16:10 ratio helps to see more lines in excel/word documents compared to 16:9 aspect ratio.

Activation also easy by giving personal email while launcing office app first time.\\n\\nSoft relatively silent keys with good travel and 2 levels of backlight for working at night. Comfortable to type for long.\\n\\nUsable 720p camera for zoom/teams call. Disable digital video stabilization setting from camera app else there will be delay in video.\\n\\nClose to 10 hour battery backup after full charge. Battery drain also reasonable under normal workloads. Battery stand by good.\\n\\nLarge trackpad which is good and supports gestures like gentle single tap for left click, gentle tap with 2 fingers together for double click which removes need for press/click of trackpad. Configure touchpad options for better results.\\n\\nGood palm rejection and comfortable edges while typing on keyboard.\\n\\nHinge closes in a smooth pleasant manner with enough cushioning\\n\\nHassle free exchange by Amazon for 7 year old base model macbook air.\\nNo cost emi for 3 months\\n\\nWhat could have been improved to make this laptop even better:\\n\\nMi 67w sonic charger which has a slim profile should have been provided instead of the rather uninspiring default legacy kind of looking LITEON company charger.\\n\\nSmall size of shift key on right takes time to get used to. Could have been a normal size shift key.\\n\\nNo dedicated sd card slot to quickly transfer photos from SLR to laptop. Have to rely on usb cables.\\n\\nNo dedicated number keys even though laptop is a 15.6 inch one. Would have been better to have dedicated number keys while working on excel.\\n\\nVoice capture using inbuilt microphone not the loudest. Use a wired or wireless headphone for voice capture.\\n\\nA bit on heavier side while picking up.May be due to the grade 6 sandblasted aluminium used.\\n\\nBacklight doesn't stay on. Goes off after sometime of inactivity and has to be renabled. But it seems there is an option in bios to keep it on the whole time once selected.\\n\\nDefault sound output from speakers not loud enough. Only once games mode is selected and equalizer is enabled from inbuilt dts app does the sound output cross 80 decibel.\", \"We'll crafted, light weight laptop with top notch internals. Value for money at this price range compared to other exclusive laptop brands .\", \"If productivity is your main agenda in a windows package, then it really doesn't get better than this.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol. Another example after the iPhone 11 that proves higher resolution != better display.\\n\\nI have an old hp pavilion 14 x360 (14inch 1080p), LG 22MK600M monitor (22 inch IPS LCD 1080p), Lenovo L24i-30 monitor (24 inch IPS LCD 1080p) to compare with and have to say color reproduction is not at all natural on the Mi laptop. And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch. Only display didn't reach the expectation.\", \"Best possible clone of MacBook in your budget.\\n\\nI tried to install MacOS and shared this photo with my friends and they thought it was MacBook 😂\\nPros -\\n1) Metal build\\n2) Battery backup (my case 6-7hrs)\\n3) Display quality with 90hz performs really well for editing\\n4) Wi-Fi 6 has great connectivity and has thunderbolt 4 port\\n\\nCons-\\n1) It would be great if it come with Ryzen variant and 2gb graphics card\\n2) Intel iris xe donot performs well in high end games (tried watch dogs2)\\n3) the velcro for binding the charger wire is little small and can have problem while binding the wires\\n\\nOverall it is a good clone for MacBook which comes in a pocket.

On the 6th day, the laptop went into a continuous restart loop which I fixed with hard shut down 3 times after watching some YouTube videos. And then it was working okay for 2 days. Now it doesn't even start. The charge light also doesn't come on. Nothing happens on pressing the power button. Nothing happens when you connect the charger. It's dead. Need to take it to the service center just 10 days into the purchase! Don't buy this, all the great specs are useless if it doesn't start!\\n\\nUpdate 13/09: I gave it for service and they are saying the battery and motherboard is defective and they need to replace it! I'm shocked. It's a brand new laptop and in 10 days the battery and motherboard is gone? How can that happen? I've hardly even used it! And they also say that since it's a new laptop the parts are taking time to come to the service center! Better to buy a reliable HP, Dell, Lenovo laptop even if it's a bit more expensive!\\n\\nUpdate 20/09: It has been with Mi service center for 8 days now. Everytime I call them they say it will get fixed in 2 days. On probing further they said there is a hardware problem. The battery and motherboard needs to be replaced! Wow I can't understand how the battery and motherboard can have problems in just 10 days of purchase? It's clearly a manufacturing defect from Xiaomi. They say they have ordered the parts but they haven't received it since it's a new model! Unbelievable!\\n\\nJust lost lot of money and peace with this laptop! Don't trust Xiaomi from now.\\n\\n23/09: They called me from the service center and asked me to collect a replacement laptop. I got a brand new laptop unopened and I opened it and checked in the service center itself. It seems that they couldn't fix the old laptop and had to send it back, so I got lucky.

The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX. Its like playing on a GT 750 which is still better than not having a GPU in this chip shortage.\\n\\nIt comes with Intel NVMe which is almost twice faster than ordinary SSDs. Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price.

Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

Support is handled by Lenovo India support team and the response was superb. The service personnel patiently attended to all the issues. Some driver updates here and there resolved the issue for a while. It reappeared again after a week. But luckily by that time Windows 11 update became available for the model. I upgraded successfully to Windows 11 and both Wifi and Bluetooth is working now. But not sure if the issue will pop up again after a while. Fingers crossed.\", 'Play Video\\n Help please.\\nI am not gettibg this ( yahoo mail) on full screen\\nRight click does not operate', 'Everything is good but its only 1.9GHZ not as mentioned in description 3.9GHZ overall budget best product best specs all rounder, perfomance is absolutely good, it came with ms office, getting i7 at this price is great deal', \"Writing this review after using it for 2 months. I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX. Its like playing on a GT 750 which is still better than not having a GPU in this chip shortage.\\n\\nIt comes with Intel NVMe which is almost twice faster than ordinary SSDs. Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time. This product is excellent and meet my expectation. Good value for money. Slim, easy to use and many features available.', 'Pros- Nice look, i7 at this price, value for money.

Camera quality is not good.\\n4. Seems Xiaomi compromised on Charger , quality is ok don't know about the durability and also on charger it shows other brand name\", \"No slim book with 16 GB ram, 3.2k display and an aluminum chassis at this price. Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.\\n\\nLow sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.\", \"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop. This is a real bummer, the thunderbolt port also doesny charge the laptop.\\n\\nThe webcam and the speakers are also totally useless. So a video call was a disspointing experience.\\n\\nAnd the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me. All mi support could do was redirect me to a youtube video and microsoft directly. I wasn't able to work around the error msg: office home and student is not associated to your account. Hope it works for others.\\n\\nHappy with the build quality, display, wifi 6 and fast ports.\\nRest all is just gimick unless some miraculous software update can fix the speakers, webcam and charging options.\", \"Pros\\n\\nGreat price to value proposition. Similar spec laptops cost twice as much from established brands.\\n\\nBeautiful 15.6 inch anti glare 16:10 aspect ratio matte screen. 16:10 ratio helps to see more lines in excel/word documents compared to 16:9 aspect ratio. But 16:9 seems more suited for viewing videos since no horizontal black bars at the top and bottom of screen.\\n\\nElegant looks in full metallic body. Grey colour variant looks stunning. Like an affordable windows macbook. Solid built with no flex in the laptop body.\\n\\nThunderbolt 4 port for versatile connectivity. Connect 2 4k monitors simultaneously from same thunderbolt port.

Activation also easy by giving personal email while launcing office app first time.\\n\\nSoft relatively silent keys with good travel and 2 levels of backlight for working at night. Comfortable to type for long.\\n\\nUsable 720p camera for zoom/teams call. Disable digital video stabilization setting from camera app else there will be delay in video.\\n\\nClose to 10 hour battery backup after full charge. Battery drain also reasonable under normal workloads. Battery stand by good.\\n\\nLarge trackpad which is good and supports gestures like gentle single tap for left click, gentle tap with 2 fingers together for double click which removes need for press/click of trackpad. Configure touchpad options for better results.\\n\\nGood palm rejection and comfortable edges while typing on keyboard.\\n\\nHinge closes in a smooth pleasant manner with enough cushioning\\n\\nHassle free exchange by Amazon for 7 year old base model macbook air.\\nNo cost emi for 3 months\\n\\nWhat could have been improved to make this laptop even better:\\n\\nMi 67w sonic charger which has a slim profile should have been provided instead of the rather uninspiring default legacy kind of looking LITEON company charger.\\n\\nSmall size of shift key on right takes time to get used to. Could have been a normal size shift key.\\n\\nNo dedicated sd card slot to quickly transfer photos from SLR to laptop. Have to rely on usb cables.\\n\\nNo dedicated number keys even though laptop is a 15.6 inch one. Would have been better to have dedicated number keys while working on excel.\\n\\nVoice capture using inbuilt microphone not the loudest. Use a wired or wireless headphone for voice capture.\\n\\nA bit on heavier side while picking up.May be due to the grade 6 sandblasted aluminium used.\\n\\nBacklight doesn't stay on. Goes off after sometime of inactivity and has to be renabled. But it seems there is an option in bios to keep it on the whole time once selected.\\n\\nDefault sound output from speakers not loud enough. Only once games mode is selected and equalizer is enabled from inbuilt dts app does the sound output cross 80 decibel.\", \"We'll crafted, light weight laptop with top notch internals.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol.

And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch.

Now it doesn't even start. The charge light also doesn't come on. Nothing happens on pressing the power button. Nothing happens when you connect the charger. It's dead. Need to take it to the service center just 10 days into the purchase! Don't buy this, all the great specs are useless if it doesn't start!\\n\\nUpdate 13/09: I gave it for service and they are saying the battery and motherboard is defective and they need to replace it! I'm shocked. It's a brand new laptop and in 10 days the battery and motherboard is gone? How can that happen? I've hardly even used it! And they also say that since it's a new laptop the parts are taking time to come to the service center! Better to buy a reliable HP, Dell, Lenovo laptop even if it's a bit more expensive!\\n\\nUpdate 20/09: It has been with Mi service center for 8 days now. Everytime I call them they say it will get fixed in 2 days. On probing further they said there is a hardware problem. The battery and motherboard needs to be replaced! Wow I can't understand how the battery and motherboard can have problems in just 10 days of purchase? It's clearly a manufacturing defect from Xiaomi. They say they have ordered the parts but they haven't received it since it's a new model! Unbelievable!\\n\\nJust lost lot of money and peace with this laptop! Don't trust Xiaomi from now.\\n\\n23/09: They called me from the service center and asked me to collect a replacement laptop. I got a brand new laptop unopened and I opened it and checked in the service center itself. It seems that they couldn't fix the old laptop and had to send it back, so I got lucky.

I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX. Its like playing on a GT 750 which is still better than not having a GPU in this chip shortage.\\n\\nIt comes with Intel NVMe which is almost twice faster than ordinary SSDs. Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2.

For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM).

Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.\\n\\nLow sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.\", \"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop.

So a video call was a disspointing experience.\\n\\nAnd the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me.

Have to rely on usb cables.\\n\\nNo dedicated number keys even though laptop is a 15.6 inch one. Would have been better to have dedicated number keys while working on excel.\\n\\nVoice capture using inbuilt microphone not the loudest. Use a wired or wireless headphone for voice capture.\\n\\nA bit on heavier side while picking up.May be due to the grade 6 sandblasted aluminium used.\\n\\nBacklight doesn't stay on.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol.

And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch.

Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor.

For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM).

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price.

It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM).

Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck.

Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho.

And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch.

I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX.

Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body.

Some driver updates here and there resolved the issue for a while. It reappeared again after a week. But luckily by that time Windows 11 update became available for the model.

NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor.

For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM).

Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed.

Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly.

And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch.

NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor.

For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM).

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

I just lost around 90k of my hard earned money on this scam.\\n\\nUpdate on 9th Nov 2021\\nAfter a long conversation with Amazon support agent, I was able to connect to the support number published by Fujitsu. Looks like the message we hear when the line is busy is misleading. Once the call got through to Fujitsu support, things were pretty smooth. Support is handled by Lenovo India support team and the response was superb. The service personnel patiently attended to all the issues. Some driver updates here and there resolved the issue for a while. It reappeared again after a week. But luckily by that time Windows 11 update became available for the model.

I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX.

Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup.

The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed.

Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol. Another example after the iPhone 11 that proves higher resolution != better display.\\n\\nI have an old hp pavilion 14 x360 (14inch 1080p), LG 22MK600M monitor (22 inch IPS LCD 1080p), Lenovo L24i-30 monitor (24 inch IPS LCD 1080p) to compare with and have to say color reproduction is not at all natural on the Mi laptop. And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch. Only display didn't reach the expectation.\", \"Best possible clone of MacBook in your budget.\\n\\nI tried to install MacOS and shared this photo with my friends and they thought it was MacBook 😂\\nPros -\\n1) Metal build\\n2) Battery backup (my case 6-7hrs)\\n3) Display quality with 90hz performs really well for editing\\n4) Wi-Fi 6 has great connectivity and has thunderbolt 4 port\\n\\nCons-\\n1) It would be great if it come with Ryzen variant and 2gb graphics card\\n2) Intel iris xe donot performs well in high end games (tried watch dogs2)\\n3) the velcro for binding the charger wire is little small and can have problem while binding the wires\\n\\nOverall it is a good clone for MacBook which comes in a pocket.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6.. Takes thin and light to the next level.. Have owned 2 Zenbooks before, this is lighter and with better build quality.. Hoping they do a good job on service as well..', \"I brought this Laptop 3 days back. Excellent product. Typical Japanese Design with Simplicity. The most advantage is you have full connectivity. You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

Tried all the software and driver reinstallation instructions available online with no success. Tried contacting the customer care number and got a message that the number or service doesn't exist. Called the local customer service point listed in Fujitsu site. Even that number is fake or incorrect. Looks like it is a scam. Product quality is pathetic. Speaker sounds like the one we get in local chor bazars. Kindly note that return and refund option is not available. You might get the same sub par product as a replacement even if you raise a complaint. Kindly avoid this product at any cost. I just lost around 90k of my hard earned money on this scam.\\n\\nUpdate on 9th Nov 2021\\nAfter a long conversation with Amazon support agent, I was able to connect to the support number published by Fujitsu. Looks like the message we hear when the line is busy is misleading. Once the call got through to Fujitsu support, things were pretty smooth. Support is handled by Lenovo India support team and the response was superb. The service personnel patiently attended to all the issues. Some driver updates here and there resolved the issue for a while. It reappeared again after a week. But luckily by that time Windows 11 update became available for the model. I upgraded successfully to Windows 11 and both Wifi and Bluetooth is working now. But not sure if the issue will pop up again after a while. Fingers crossed.\", 'Play Video\\n Help please.\\nI am not gettibg this ( yahoo mail) on full screen\\nRight click does not operate', 'Everything is good but its only 1.9GHZ not as mentioned in description 3.9GHZ overall budget best product best specs all rounder, perfomance is absolutely good, it came with ms office, getting i7 at this price is great deal', \"Writing this review after using it for 2 months. I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX. Its like playing on a GT 750 which is still better than not having a GPU in this chip shortage.\\n\\nIt comes with Intel NVMe which is almost twice faster than ordinary SSDs. Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time.

The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed.

Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop. This is a real bummer, the thunderbolt port also doesny charge the laptop.\\n\\nThe webcam and the speakers are also totally useless. So a video call was a disspointing experience.\\n\\nAnd the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me. All mi support could do was redirect me to a youtube video and microsoft directly. I wasn't able to work around the error msg: office home and student is not associated to your account. Hope it works for others.\\n\\nHappy with the build quality, display, wifi 6 and fast ports.\\nRest all is just gimick unless some miraculous software update can fix the speakers, webcam and charging options.\", \"Pros\\n\\nGreat price to value proposition. Similar spec laptops cost twice as much from established brands.\\n\\nBeautiful 15.6 inch anti glare 16:10 aspect ratio matte screen. 16:10 ratio helps to see more lines in excel/word documents compared to 16:9 aspect ratio. But 16:9 seems more suited for viewing videos since no horizontal black bars at the top and bottom of screen.\\n\\nElegant looks in full metallic body. Grey colour variant looks stunning. Like an affordable windows macbook. Solid built with no flex in the laptop body.\\n\\nThunderbolt 4 port for versatile connectivity. Connect 2 4k monitors simultaneously from same thunderbolt port. Thunderbolt is exclusive to 11th gen Intel core i5/i7 and not available yet in AMD ryzen 7 series processors.\\n\\nCharge through either thunderbolt port or type c port\\n\\nMacro key which can be used to quick launch an app like chrome by drag and drop of app into the macro key input area.\\n\\nBattery charge indicator with 3 colours. Red for charge less than 20, orange from 20 to 90 and green for charge more than 90 percentage.\\n\\n90hz display with 3k resolution. Scrolling very smooth. fn+s key to switch between 60hz and 90hz refresh rate\\n\\nCore i7 11th gen processor - breeze through normal workloads. Haven't heard the cooling fans kicking in yet.\\n\\n512gb nvme ssd for speedy launch of programming ide like pycharm.\\n\\n16gb ram - most of the time 8 gb free\\n\\nIntel iris graphics - haven't tried any games yet but 4k YouTube videos are smooth.\\n\\nWifi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1 for reliable connectivity.\\n\\n65w usb type c charger - full charge in 90 mins.\\nCan use 65w mobile phone charger to charge this laptop.\\n\\nFingerprint sensor and power button combined.\\n\\nGood loud speakers after enabling games mode on inbuilt dts app and turning on Equalizer.\\n\\nLifetime validity Office 2019 included - get ready to work on excel Power point etc without spending additional for Microsoft office software. Activation also easy by giving personal email while launcing office app first time.\\n\\nSoft relatively silent keys with good travel and 2 levels of backlight for working at night. Comfortable to type for long.\\n\\nUsable 720p camera for zoom/teams call. Disable digital video stabilization setting from camera app else there will be delay in video.\\n\\nClose to 10 hour battery backup after full charge. Battery drain also reasonable under normal workloads. Battery stand by good.\\n\\nLarge trackpad which is good and supports gestures like gentle single tap for left click, gentle tap with 2 fingers together for double click which removes need for press/click of trackpad. Configure touchpad options for better results.\\n\\nGood palm rejection and comfortable edges while typing on keyboard.\\n\\nHinge closes in a smooth pleasant manner with enough cushioning\\n\\nHassle free exchange by Amazon for 7 year old base model macbook air.\\nNo cost emi for 3 months\\n\\nWhat could have been improved to make this laptop even better:\\n\\nMi 67w sonic charger which has a slim profile should have been provided instead of the rather uninspiring default legacy kind of looking LITEON company charger.\\n\\nSmall size of shift key on right takes time to get used to. Could have been a normal size shift key.\\n\\nNo dedicated sd card slot to quickly transfer photos from SLR to laptop. Have to rely on usb cables.\\n\\nNo dedicated number keys even though laptop is a 15.6 inch one. Would have been better to have dedicated number keys while working on excel.\\n\\nVoice capture using inbuilt microphone not the loudest. Use a wired or wireless headphone for voice capture.\\n\\nA bit on heavier side while picking up.May be due to the grade 6 sandblasted aluminium used.\\n\\nBacklight doesn't stay on. Goes off after sometime of inactivity and has to be renabled. But it seems there is an option in bios to keep it on the whole time once selected.\\n\\nDefault sound output from speakers not loud enough. Only once games mode is selected and equalizer is enabled from inbuilt dts app does the sound output cross 80 decibel.\", \"We'll crafted, light weight laptop with top notch internals. Value for money at this price range compared to other exclusive laptop brands .\", \"If productivity is your main agenda in a windows package, then it really doesn't get better than this.

Buy it without a second thought.\", 'Read above rating as 4.5/5.\\n\\nUpgraded from an era old Hp Laptop. Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol. Another example after the iPhone 11 that proves higher resolution != better display.\\n\\nI have an old hp pavilion 14 x360 (14inch 1080p), LG 22MK600M monitor (22 inch IPS LCD 1080p), Lenovo L24i-30 monitor (24 inch IPS LCD 1080p) to compare with and have to say color reproduction is not at all natural on the Mi laptop. And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch. Only display didn't reach the expectation.\", \"Best possible clone of MacBook in your budget.\\n\\nI tried to install MacOS and shared this photo with my friends and they thought it was MacBook 😂\\nPros -\\n1) Metal build\\n2) Battery backup (my case 6-7hrs)\\n3) Display quality with 90hz performs really well for editing\\n4) Wi-Fi 6 has great connectivity and has thunderbolt 4 port\\n\\nCons-\\n1) It would be great if it come with Ryzen variant and 2gb graphics card\\n2) Intel iris xe donot performs well in high end games (tried watch dogs2)\\n3) the velcro for binding the charger wire is little small and can have problem while binding the wires\\n\\nOverall it is a good clone for MacBook which comes in a pocket.

But on 18th the option of chat contact was also closed (return window closed on 17th, - I did not understand the connection as the question is not about return)nor did I get any response through email.

SAD, I bought it under the impression I could buy mi extended warranty after purchase of the product :(', ' 😡😡after 3 days it was turning on but the display was black . no light in worst experience from xiaomi .\\nwhen you buy a product for 64k price you expect from that .. and in just three days😡😡', ' Backlight screen bleeding in my xiaomi notebook ultra. Too much disappointing.I want t replace the laptop.', 'Got it delivered today, the build quality is great, display is amazing. Performance is also good.\\nOnly disappoinment is with sound. It is very low, even ur mobile sound could be louder then this. Xiaomi should definitely work on this.', \"I got my laptop delivered today from Amazon. As I was looking for an extended warranty, I called mi.com and was asked to call oneassist to get the warranty. They offered extended two years warranty at 6499 while the same plan if purchased from mi.com along with the laptop is 3699. I called mi customer care and the reason given was since you have purchased from Amazon, our partners can't provide you at the same rate and you should have bought from mi.com. Why is this not mentioned in Amazon or mi website as a disclaimer. I felt really cheated and this is not what I expected from Amazon nor Xiaomi.\\nUpdating after using for three months. Motherboard problem in three months. Can you imagine. The c c type charging port was not working and had given to an authorised service centre. It's been three weeks and no one called back after checking the issue. When I called they are saying motherhood issue and they have ordered the part and the company is not sending the part. They asked us to call and order the part. Pls don't buy MI PRODUCT. They don't provide good service nor extented warranty.

This time I'm very Dispoinnted by amazon....\", 'I received the laptop on 22 sep 2021. Its build is superb, display is by far the best. But on just the third day of usage the keyboard started to malfunction. Somehow the keyboard is behaving as if the shift keys are randomly presses. All trackpad functions first malfunctioning then all of a sudden it just stopped working. Now i am thinking that did i do any mistake in placing my trust in Xiaomi. Are they giving cheap quality hardware packed in a high quality build??? Hoping to see a quick resolution to my problem.', 'Pathetic quality. Keyboard failed within a week. Stay away from this and buy a good brand.', 'Everything is good but its only 1.9GHZ not as mentioned in description 3.9GHZ overall budget best product best specs all rounder, perfomance is absolutely good, it came with ms office, getting i7 at this price is great deal', \"Writing this review after using it for 2 months. I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX. Its like playing on a GT 750 which is still better than not having a GPU in this chip shortage.\\n\\nIt comes with Intel NVMe which is almost twice faster than ordinary SSDs. Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time. This product is excellent and meet my expectation. Good value for money. Slim, easy to use and many features available.', 'Pros- Nice look, i7 at this price, value for money. Cons- keypad back light not available, dedicated graphics card not available.', 'Bags should be there along with it', \"It's value for money\", 'You wont get a laptop in this price with i7 and 16gb on top of that and it is very light weight also It has only one thing missing that is backlit keyboard but acc to me that should not be a problem because you are getting i7 and 16 gb ram in price of a i5 laptop', 'ASU’s Laptop\\nOverall laptop fulfils my requirements, I am using it for educational and entertainment purposes. Screen quality looks good. Sound quality is good but when we connect blue tooth speaker it will be excellent. Tested battery backup with full charge battery came down to 50% with 3 hrs.

Also premium look and casing with Thinkbook branding.\\n+ Very good (lightning) deal for INR 79990/-.\\n\\n+ Found performance good.\\nApp load times was quicker (eg MS Excel). I think the iris xe graphics is helping render the webpages faster and smoother.\\n+ Fast charging works !.. on USB-C.\\n+ Mic is good and used it on zoom meeting.

Geekbench 5 scores are 1617 single-core and 6061 multi-core. Using the Stream benchmark, peak memory bandwidth is 61 GB/s for copy.\\n\\n* Without videoconferencing the battery lasts around 8 hours. With constant videoconferencing it lasts around 4 hours.\\n\\n* Linux (Debian Bullseye) works out of the box except for the fingerprint sensor. Suspend usually works and uses ~0.15% battery per hour of suspend. But I'm seeing occassional failures to suspend.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n* The keyboard is quite shallow. Accurate, but not much fun to type on.\\n\\n* The SSD is fast for small sequential reads and writes, around 5 GB/s. But for very large sequential writes the speed falls to around 600 MB/s.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

Hoping they do a good job on service as well..', \"I brought this Laptop 3 days back. Excellent product. Typical Japanese Design with Simplicity. The most advantage is you have full connectivity. You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2.

For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM).

Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.\\n\\nLow sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.\", \"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop.

So a video call was a disspointing experience.\\n\\nAnd the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me.

Have to rely on usb cables.\\n\\nNo dedicated number keys even though laptop is a 15.6 inch one. Would have been better to have dedicated number keys while working on excel.\\n\\nVoice capture using inbuilt microphone not the loudest. Use a wired or wireless headphone for voice capture.\\n\\nA bit on heavier side while picking up.May be due to the grade 6 sandblasted aluminium used.\\n\\nBacklight doesn't stay on.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol.

And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch.

Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor.

For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM).

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body.

The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed.

Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking.

Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly.

I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated.

Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6.. Takes thin and light to the next level.. Have owned 2 Zenbooks before, this is lighter and with better build quality.. Hoping they do a good job on service as well..', \"I brought this Laptop 3 days back. Excellent product. Typical Japanese Design with Simplicity. The most advantage is you have full connectivity. You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

Tried all the software and driver reinstallation instructions available online with no success. Tried contacting the customer care number and got a message that the number or service doesn't exist. Called the local customer service point listed in Fujitsu site. Even that number is fake or incorrect. Looks like it is a scam. Product quality is pathetic. Speaker sounds like the one we get in local chor bazars. Kindly note that return and refund option is not available. You might get the same sub par product as a replacement even if you raise a complaint. Kindly avoid this product at any cost. I just lost around 90k of my hard earned money on this scam.\\n\\nUpdate on 9th Nov 2021\\nAfter a long conversation with Amazon support agent, I was able to connect to the support number published by Fujitsu. Looks like the message we hear when the line is busy is misleading. Once the call got through to Fujitsu support, things were pretty smooth. Support is handled by Lenovo India support team and the response was superb. The service personnel patiently attended to all the issues. Some driver updates here and there resolved the issue for a while. It reappeared again after a week. But luckily by that time Windows 11 update became available for the model. I upgraded successfully to Windows 11 and both Wifi and Bluetooth is working now. But not sure if the issue will pop up again after a while. Fingers crossed.\", 'Play Video\\n Help please.\\nI am not gettibg this ( yahoo mail) on full screen\\nRight click does not operate', 'Everything is good but its only 1.9GHZ not as mentioned in description 3.9GHZ overall budget best product best specs all rounder, perfomance is absolutely good, it came with ms office, getting i7 at this price is great deal', \"Writing this review after using it for 2 months. I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX. Its like playing on a GT 750 which is still better than not having a GPU in this chip shortage.\\n\\nIt comes with Intel NVMe which is almost twice faster than ordinary SSDs. Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time.

Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.\\n\\nLow sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.\", \"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop. This is a real bummer, the thunderbolt port also doesny charge the laptop.\\n\\nThe webcam and the speakers are also totally useless. So a video call was a disspointing experience.\\n\\nAnd the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me.

Buy it without a second thought.\", 'Read above rating as 4.5/5.\\n\\nUpgraded from an era old Hp Laptop. Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol. Another example after the iPhone 11 that proves higher resolution != better display.\\n\\nI have an old hp pavilion 14 x360 (14inch 1080p), LG 22MK600M monitor (22 inch IPS LCD 1080p), Lenovo L24i-30 monitor (24 inch IPS LCD 1080p) to compare with and have to say color reproduction is not at all natural on the Mi laptop. And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch.

Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time. This product is excellent and meet my expectation. Good value for money. Slim, easy to use and many features available.', 'Pros- Nice look, i7 at this price, value for money. Cons- keypad back light not available, dedicated graphics card not available.', 'Bags should be there along with it', \"It's value for money\", 'You wont get a laptop in this price with i7 and 16gb on top of that and it is very light weight also It has only one thing missing that is backlit keyboard but acc to me that should not be a problem because you are getting i7 and 16 gb ram in price of a i5 laptop', 'ASU’s Laptop\\nOverall laptop fulfils my requirements, I am using it for educational and entertainment purposes. Screen quality looks good. Sound quality is good but when we connect blue tooth speaker it will be excellent. Tested battery backup with full charge battery came down to 50% with 3 hrs.

Also premium look and casing with Thinkbook branding.\\n+ Very good (lightning) deal for INR 79990/-.\\n\\n+ Found performance good.\\nApp load times was quicker (eg MS Excel). I think the iris xe graphics is helping render the webpages faster and smoother.\\n+ Fast charging works !.. on USB-C.\\n+ Mic is good and used it on zoom meeting.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

Some driver updates here and there resolved the issue for a while. It reappeared again after a week. But luckily by that time Windows 11 update became available for the model.

I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX. Its like playing on a GT 750 which is still better than not having a GPU in this chip shortage.\\n\\nIt comes with Intel NVMe which is almost twice faster than ordinary SSDs. Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time.

Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.\\n\\nLow sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.\", \"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop. This is a real bummer, the thunderbolt port also doesny charge the laptop.\\n\\nThe webcam and the speakers are also totally useless. So a video call was a disspointing experience.\\n\\nAnd the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me. All mi support could do was redirect me to a youtube video and microsoft directly. I wasn't able to work around the error msg: office home and student is not associated to your account. Hope it works for others.\\n\\nHappy with the build quality, display, wifi 6 and fast ports.\\nRest all is just gimick unless some miraculous software update can fix the speakers, webcam and charging options.\", \"Pros\\n\\nGreat price to value proposition.

Activation also easy by giving personal email while launcing office app first time.\\n\\nSoft relatively silent keys with good travel and 2 levels of backlight for working at night. Comfortable to type for long.\\n\\nUsable 720p camera for zoom/teams call. Disable digital video stabilization setting from camera app else there will be delay in video.\\n\\nClose to 10 hour battery backup after full charge. Battery drain also reasonable under normal workloads. Battery stand by good.\\n\\nLarge trackpad which is good and supports gestures like gentle single tap for left click, gentle tap with 2 fingers together for double click which removes need for press/click of trackpad.

Could have been a normal size shift key.\\n\\nNo dedicated sd card slot to quickly transfer photos from SLR to laptop. Have to rely on usb cables.\\n\\nNo dedicated number keys even though laptop is a 15.6 inch one. Would have been better to have dedicated number keys while working on excel.\\n\\nVoice capture using inbuilt microphone not the loudest. Use a wired or wireless headphone for voice capture.\\n\\nA bit on heavier side while picking up.May be due to the grade 6 sandblasted aluminium used.\\n\\nBacklight doesn't stay on. Goes off after sometime of inactivity and has to be renabled. But it seems there is an option in bios to keep it on the whole time once selected.\\n\\nDefault sound output from speakers not loud enough. Only once games mode is selected and equalizer is enabled from inbuilt dts app does the sound output cross 80 decibel.\", \"We'll crafted, light weight laptop with top notch internals.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol.

And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch.

I'm shocked. It's a brand new laptop and in 10 days the battery and motherboard is gone? How can that happen? I've hardly even used it! And they also say that since it's a new laptop the parts are taking time to come to the service center! Better to buy a reliable HP, Dell, Lenovo laptop even if it's a bit more expensive!\\n\\nUpdate 20/09: It has been with Mi service center for 8 days now. Everytime I call them they say it will get fixed in 2 days. On probing further they said there is a hardware problem. The battery and motherboard needs to be replaced! Wow I can't understand how the battery and motherboard can have problems in just 10 days of purchase? It's clearly a manufacturing defect from Xiaomi. They say they have ordered the parts but they haven't received it since it's a new model! Unbelievable!\\n\\nJust lost lot of money and peace with this laptop! Don't trust Xiaomi from now.\\n\\n23/09: They called me from the service center and asked me to collect a replacement laptop.

I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX. Its like playing on a GT 750 which is still better than not having a GPU in this chip shortage.\\n\\nIt comes with Intel NVMe which is almost twice faster than ordinary SSDs. Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

I just lost around 90k of my hard earned money on this scam.\\n\\nUpdate on 9th Nov 2021\\nAfter a long conversation with Amazon support agent, I was able to connect to the support number published by Fujitsu. Looks like the message we hear when the line is busy is misleading. Once the call got through to Fujitsu support, things were pretty smooth. Support is handled by Lenovo India support team and the response was superb. The service personnel patiently attended to all the issues. Some driver updates here and there resolved the issue for a while. It reappeared again after a week. But luckily by that time Windows 11 update became available for the model.

I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX.

Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup.

The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed.

Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol. Another example after the iPhone 11 that proves higher resolution != better display.\\n\\nI have an old hp pavilion 14 x360 (14inch 1080p), LG 22MK600M monitor (22 inch IPS LCD 1080p), Lenovo L24i-30 monitor (24 inch IPS LCD 1080p) to compare with and have to say color reproduction is not at all natural on the Mi laptop. And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch. Only display didn't reach the expectation.\", \"Best possible clone of MacBook in your budget.\\n\\nI tried to install MacOS and shared this photo with my friends and they thought it was MacBook 😂\\nPros -\\n1) Metal build\\n2) Battery backup (my case 6-7hrs)\\n3) Display quality with 90hz performs really well for editing\\n4) Wi-Fi 6 has great connectivity and has thunderbolt 4 port\\n\\nCons-\\n1) It would be great if it come with Ryzen variant and 2gb graphics card\\n2) Intel iris xe donot performs well in high end games (tried watch dogs2)\\n3) the velcro for binding the charger wire is little small and can have problem while binding the wires\\n\\nOverall it is a good clone for MacBook which comes in a pocket.

With constant videoconferencing it lasts around 4 hours.\\n\\n* Linux (Debian Bullseye) works out of the box except for the fingerprint sensor. Suspend usually works and uses ~0.15% battery per hour of suspend. But I'm seeing occassional failures to suspend.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n* The keyboard is quite shallow. Accurate, but not much fun to type on.\\n\\n* The SSD is fast for small sequential reads and writes, around 5 GB/s. But for very large sequential writes the speed falls to around 600 MB/s. This is noticeable when running software updates.\", \"If you want a laptop to last more than a few years, ThinkPads are the way to go (along with at least 8GB RAM and an i5).

Don\\'t install any software other than LG updater and LG control centre (installed DTS but it messed up my audio. Make sure to uncheck DTS while updating through LG control centre)\\n- A bit expensive (92k for 11th gen i7 16 gb Ram 16\" variant)\\n- RAM is soldered, so no further addition possible.\\n- Thermal throttles very easily. The laptop is excellent for day to day tasks like watching movies, office work, browsing, etc but if you\\'re into a lot of cpu intensive tasks like compression, video editing, gaming then DO NOT buy this as it will immediately heat up and throttle and give very bad performance.\\n\\nOverall a good laptop. Couldn\\'t give 5 stars due to its poor cooling, screen glare and high price.\\n\\nPro tip : If you\\'re only doing office work, browsing or movie watching, I\\'d suggest you put it in battery saver mode all the time. I could easily get about 12 hours of backup doing this without any performance hit.\\n\\nEdit 1 : After a month of usage, I must say I\\'m getting used to the glare.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM).

Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck.

Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol.

And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch.

I wrote to Amazon and the response was to contact in case I do not get any response by 17th.

The laptop is excellent for day to day tasks like watching movies, office work, browsing, etc but if you\\'re into a lot of cpu intensive tasks like compression, video editing, gaming then DO NOT buy this as it will immediately heat up and throttle and give very bad performance.\\n\\nOverall a good laptop.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

Tried all the software and driver reinstallation instructions available online with no success. Tried contacting the customer care number and got a message that the number or service doesn't exist. Called the local customer service point listed in Fujitsu site. Even that number is fake or incorrect. Looks like it is a scam. Product quality is pathetic. Speaker sounds like the one we get in local chor bazars. Kindly note that return and refund option is not available. You might get the same sub par product as a replacement even if you raise a complaint. Kindly avoid this product at any cost. I just lost around 90k of my hard earned money on this scam.\\n\\nUpdate on 9th Nov 2021\\nAfter a long conversation with Amazon support agent, I was able to connect to the support number published by Fujitsu. Looks like the message we hear when the line is busy is misleading. Once the call got through to Fujitsu support, things were pretty smooth. Support is handled by Lenovo India support team and the response was superb. The service personnel patiently attended to all the issues. Some driver updates here and there resolved the issue for a while. It reappeared again after a week. But luckily by that time Windows 11 update became available for the model. I upgraded successfully to Windows 11 and both Wifi and Bluetooth is working now. But not sure if the issue will pop up again after a while. Fingers crossed.\", 'Play Video\\n Help please.\\nI am not gettibg this ( yahoo mail) on full screen\\nRight click does not operate', 'Everything is good but its only 1.9GHZ not as mentioned in description 3.9GHZ overall budget best product best specs all rounder, perfomance is absolutely good, it came with ms office, getting i7 at this price is great deal', \"Writing this review after using it for 2 months. I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX. Its like playing on a GT 750 which is still better than not having a GPU in this chip shortage.\\n\\nIt comes with Intel NVMe which is almost twice faster than ordinary SSDs. Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time.

Camera quality is not good.\\n4. Seems Xiaomi compromised on Charger , quality is ok don't know about the durability and also on charger it shows other brand name\", \"No slim book with 16 GB ram, 3.2k display and an aluminum chassis at this price. Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.\\n\\nLow sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.\", \"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop. This is a real bummer, the thunderbolt port also doesny charge the laptop.\\n\\nThe webcam and the speakers are also totally useless. So a video call was a disspointing experience.\\n\\nAnd the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me. All mi support could do was redirect me to a youtube video and microsoft directly. I wasn't able to work around the error msg: office home and student is not associated to your account. Hope it works for others.\\n\\nHappy with the build quality, display, wifi 6 and fast ports.\\nRest all is just gimick unless some miraculous software update can fix the speakers, webcam and charging options.\", \"Pros\\n\\nGreat price to value proposition. Similar spec laptops cost twice as much from established brands.\\n\\nBeautiful 15.6 inch anti glare 16:10 aspect ratio matte screen. 16:10 ratio helps to see more lines in excel/word documents compared to 16:9 aspect ratio. But 16:9 seems more suited for viewing videos since no horizontal black bars at the top and bottom of screen.\\n\\nElegant looks in full metallic body. Grey colour variant looks stunning. Like an affordable windows macbook. Solid built with no flex in the laptop body.\\n\\nThunderbolt 4 port for versatile connectivity. Connect 2 4k monitors simultaneously from same thunderbolt port. Thunderbolt is exclusive to 11th gen Intel core i5/i7 and not available yet in AMD ryzen 7 series processors.\\n\\nCharge through either thunderbolt port or type c port\\n\\nMacro key which can be used to quick launch an app like chrome by drag and drop of app into the macro key input area.\\n\\nBattery charge indicator with 3 colours. Red for charge less than 20, orange from 20 to 90 and green for charge more than 90 percentage.\\n\\n90hz display with 3k resolution. Scrolling very smooth. fn+s key to switch between 60hz and 90hz refresh rate\\n\\nCore i7 11th gen processor - breeze through normal workloads. Haven't heard the cooling fans kicking in yet.\\n\\n512gb nvme ssd for speedy launch of programming ide like pycharm.\\n\\n16gb ram - most of the time 8 gb free\\n\\nIntel iris graphics - haven't tried any games yet but 4k YouTube videos are smooth.\\n\\nWifi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1 for reliable connectivity.\\n\\n65w usb type c charger - full charge in 90 mins.\\nCan use 65w mobile phone charger to charge this laptop.\\n\\nFingerprint sensor and power button combined.\\n\\nGood loud speakers after enabling games mode on inbuilt dts app and turning on Equalizer.\\n\\nLifetime validity Office 2019 included - get ready to work on excel Power point etc without spending additional for Microsoft office software. Activation also easy by giving personal email while launcing office app first time.\\n\\nSoft relatively silent keys with good travel and 2 levels of backlight for working at night. Comfortable to type for long.\\n\\nUsable 720p camera for zoom/teams call. Disable digital video stabilization setting from camera app else there will be delay in video.\\n\\nClose to 10 hour battery backup after full charge. Battery drain also reasonable under normal workloads. Battery stand by good.\\n\\nLarge trackpad which is good and supports gestures like gentle single tap for left click, gentle tap with 2 fingers together for double click which removes need for press/click of trackpad. Configure touchpad options for better results.\\n\\nGood palm rejection and comfortable edges while typing on keyboard.\\n\\nHinge closes in a smooth pleasant manner with enough cushioning\\n\\nHassle free exchange by Amazon for 7 year old base model macbook air.\\nNo cost emi for 3 months\\n\\nWhat could have been improved to make this laptop even better:\\n\\nMi 67w sonic charger which has a slim profile should have been provided instead of the rather uninspiring default legacy kind of looking LITEON company charger.\\n\\nSmall size of shift key on right takes time to get used to. Could have been a normal size shift key.\\n\\nNo dedicated sd card slot to quickly transfer photos from SLR to laptop. Have to rely on usb cables.\\n\\nNo dedicated number keys even though laptop is a 15.6 inch one. Would have been better to have dedicated number keys while working on excel.\\n\\nVoice capture using inbuilt microphone not the loudest. Use a wired or wireless headphone for voice capture.\\n\\nA bit on heavier side while picking up.May be due to the grade 6 sandblasted aluminium used.\\n\\nBacklight doesn't stay on. Goes off after sometime of inactivity and has to be renabled. But it seems there is an option in bios to keep it on the whole time once selected.\\n\\nDefault sound output from speakers not loud enough. Only once games mode is selected and equalizer is enabled from inbuilt dts app does the sound output cross 80 decibel.\", \"We'll crafted, light weight laptop with top notch internals. Value for money at this price range compared to other exclusive laptop brands .\", \"If productivity is your main agenda in a windows package, then it really doesn't get better than this. The value this laptop provides is unmatched in the market , especially the display which is going to leave your breathless. This is pure windows in a good hardware package by Xiaomi.

Buy it without a second thought.\", 'Read above rating as 4.5/5.\\n\\nUpgraded from an era old Hp Laptop. Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol. Another example after the iPhone 11 that proves higher resolution != better display.\\n\\nI have an old hp pavilion 14 x360 (14inch 1080p), LG 22MK600M monitor (22 inch IPS LCD 1080p), Lenovo L24i-30 monitor (24 inch IPS LCD 1080p) to compare with and have to say color reproduction is not at all natural on the Mi laptop. And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch. Only display didn't reach the expectation.\", \"Best possible clone of MacBook in your budget.\\n\\nI tried to install MacOS and shared this photo with my friends and they thought it was MacBook 😂\\nPros -\\n1) Metal build\\n2) Battery backup (my case 6-7hrs)\\n3) Display quality with 90hz performs really well for editing\\n4) Wi-Fi 6 has great connectivity and has thunderbolt 4 port\\n\\nCons-\\n1) It would be great if it come with Ryzen variant and 2gb graphics card\\n2) Intel iris xe donot performs well in high end games (tried watch dogs2)\\n3) the velcro for binding the charger wire is little small and can have problem while binding the wires\\n\\nOverall it is a good clone for MacBook which comes in a pocket.

But on 18th the option of chat contact was also closed (return window closed on 17th, - I did not understand the connection as the question is not about return)nor did I get any response through email.

I'm shocked. It's a brand new laptop and in 10 days the battery and motherboard is gone? How can that happen? I've hardly even used it! And they also say that since it's a new laptop the parts are taking time to come to the service center! Better to buy a reliable HP, Dell, Lenovo laptop even if it's a bit more expensive!\\n\\nUpdate 20/09: It has been with Mi service center for 8 days now. Everytime I call them they say it will get fixed in 2 days. On probing further they said there is a hardware problem. The battery and motherboard needs to be replaced! Wow I can't understand how the battery and motherboard can have problems in just 10 days of purchase? It's clearly a manufacturing defect from Xiaomi. They say they have ordered the parts but they haven't received it since it's a new model! Unbelievable!\\n\\nJust lost lot of money and peace with this laptop! Don't trust Xiaomi from now.\\n\\n23/09: They called me from the service center and asked me to collect a replacement laptop. I got a brand new laptop unopened and I opened it and checked in the service center itself. It seems that they couldn't fix the old laptop and had to send it back, so I got lucky. Else, I would have got a repaired one.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm happy I got a new replacement laptop and currently it's working well.\", 'Overall product is good, but charger is missing in package, and web cam is very bad quality', 'Play Video\\n You will not get an option to buy extended warranty while buying the laptop at amazon and also after receiving the laptop Mi will not let your buy the additional 2 years warranty from Mi within the 3 days of delivery...

I called mi customer care and the reason given was since you have purchased from Amazon, our partners can't provide you at the same rate and you should have bought from mi.com.

I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX. Its like playing on a GT 750 which is still better than not having a GPU in this chip shortage.\\n\\nIt comes with Intel NVMe which is almost twice faster than ordinary SSDs. Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

I just lost around 90k of my hard earned money on this scam.\\n\\nUpdate on 9th Nov 2021\\nAfter a long conversation with Amazon support agent, I was able to connect to the support number published by Fujitsu. Looks like the message we hear when the line is busy is misleading. Once the call got through to Fujitsu support, things were pretty smooth. Support is handled by Lenovo India support team and the response was superb. The service personnel patiently attended to all the issues. Some driver updates here and there resolved the issue for a while. It reappeared again after a week. But luckily by that time Windows 11 update became available for the model.

I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX.

Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup.

Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed.

Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol. Another example after the iPhone 11 that proves higher resolution != better display.\\n\\nI have an old hp pavilion 14 x360 (14inch 1080p), LG 22MK600M monitor (22 inch IPS LCD 1080p), Lenovo L24i-30 monitor (24 inch IPS LCD 1080p) to compare with and have to say color reproduction is not at all natural on the Mi laptop. And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch. Only display didn't reach the expectation.\", \"Best possible clone of MacBook in your budget.\\n\\nI tried to install MacOS and shared this photo with my friends and they thought it was MacBook 😂\\nPros -\\n1) Metal build\\n2) Battery backup (my case 6-7hrs)\\n3) Display quality with 90hz performs really well for editing\\n4) Wi-Fi 6 has great connectivity and has thunderbolt 4 port\\n\\nCons-\\n1) It would be great if it come with Ryzen variant and 2gb graphics card\\n2) Intel iris xe donot performs well in high end games (tried watch dogs2)\\n3) the velcro for binding the charger wire is little small and can have problem while binding the wires\\n\\nOverall it is a good clone for MacBook which comes in a pocket.

Geekbench 5 scores are 1617 single-core and 6061 multi-core. Using the Stream benchmark, peak memory bandwidth is 61 GB/s for copy.\\n\\n* Without videoconferencing the battery lasts around 8 hours. With constant videoconferencing it lasts around 4 hours.\\n\\n* Linux (Debian Bullseye) works out of the box except for the fingerprint sensor. Suspend usually works and uses ~0.15% battery per hour of suspend. But I'm seeing occassional failures to suspend.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n* The keyboard is quite shallow. Accurate, but not much fun to type on.\\n\\n* The SSD is fast for small sequential reads and writes, around 5 GB/s. But for very large sequential writes the speed falls to around 600 MB/s. This is noticeable when running software updates.\", \"If you want a laptop to last more than a few years, ThinkPads are the way to go (along with at least 8GB RAM and an i5).

Almost reflects like a mirror under certain lighting making it very difficult to watch movies, although the glare disappears at night while the room tubelight is on. Be prepared to install a screen guard if necessary\\n- LG inbuilt software not easily available. Download it from the LG USA site under the 14\" variant. Don\\'t install any software other than LG updater and LG control centre (installed DTS but it messed up my audio. Make sure to uncheck DTS while updating through LG control centre)\\n- A bit expensive (92k for 11th gen i7 16 gb Ram 16\" variant)\\n- RAM is soldered, so no further addition possible.\\n- Thermal throttles very easily. The laptop is excellent for day to day tasks like watching movies, office work, browsing, etc but if you\\'re into a lot of cpu intensive tasks like compression, video editing, gaming then DO NOT buy this as it will immediately heat up and throttle and give very bad performance.\\n\\nOverall a good laptop. Couldn\\'t give 5 stars due to its poor cooling, screen glare and high price.\\n\\nPro tip : If you\\'re only doing office work, browsing or movie watching, I\\'d suggest you put it in battery saver mode all the time. I could easily get about 12 hours of backup doing this without any performance hit.\\n\\nEdit 1 : After a month of usage, I must say I\\'m getting used to the glare.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body.

NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor.

For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM).

Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed.

Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this).

I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green.

Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch.

Almost reflects like a mirror under certain lighting making it very difficult to watch movies, although the glare disappears at night while the room tubelight is on. Be prepared to install a screen guard if necessary\\n- LG inbuilt software not easily available. Download it from the LG USA site under the 14\" variant. Don\\'t install any software other than LG updater and LG control centre (installed DTS but it messed up my audio. Make sure to uncheck DTS while updating through LG control centre)\\n- A bit expensive (92k for 11th gen i7 16 gb Ram 16\" variant)\\n- RAM is soldered, so no further addition possible.\\n- Thermal throttles very easily. The laptop is excellent for day to day tasks like watching movies, office work, browsing, etc but if you\\'re into a lot of cpu intensive tasks like compression, video editing, gaming then DO NOT buy this as it will immediately heat up and throttle and give very bad performance.\\n\\nOverall a good laptop. Couldn\\'t give 5 stars due to its poor cooling, screen glare and high price.\\n\\nPro tip : If you\\'re only doing office work, browsing or movie watching, I\\'d suggest you put it in battery saver mode all the time. I could easily get about 12 hours of backup doing this without any performance hit.\\n\\nEdit 1 : After a month of usage, I must say I\\'m getting used to the glare. I just set the brightness to max while watching movies during daytime, and even though I can still see the reflection of my face on the screen like a mirror, I\\'m learning to ignore it.', 'One if the most innovative products available in the market\\n\\nNormally any laptop above 14inch is either budget product or a premium mobile workstation costing upwards of lakhs and compromised mobility.\\n\\nLG gram 16 is one of the few machines which is not a MacBook ripoff .

Second one that I received had display issue where the light was bleeding. Again asked for replacement but Amazon refused again and are refunding the amount. Loosing the discount which is clearly bad policy from amazon. Overall laptop is very light weight but performance on i7 with 16gb just satisfactory as LG reserve it to 15w TDP.\\nCompared to i7 from HP or Lenevo performance is just about ok.\", '**Update**\\nAfter 3 weeks of usage the laptop display became faulty. LG has THE worst customer (or should I say, non-existent) service. There is no service personnel assigned after a week of raising complaint in the online portal. After several follow-ups, LG assigned a service agent who asked if my \"fridge\" needs to be repaired, followed by another agent asking if my \"washing machine\" needs to be repaired. I finally gave up and requested Amazon for a refund. I am thankful that Amazon has agreed.\\n\\nGot the i7 model, 16GB RAM during the Diwali sale.

Now have some brains and tell me, I ordered this product along with other items whose total cost was around 1.5L and I got some cashbacks while ordering for more than 1L amount, now if they refund my money, they'll deduct all my cashbacks that I've got, and it'll totally be useless shopping for me. This was their mistake that they delivered me bad product twice with the worst delivery experience and because of them, I need to suffer with my cashbacks and credit amount. This is totally unacceptable. Awaiting for callback from the tech team, and it's totally a problem from Amazon's end not from my end. I am purchasing a product worth more than 92k I can't just accept it whatever they give. They've kept all the damaged product at amazon. I have been a regular customer of Amazon since more than 5-6 years, it would have been better if I had chose some.other e-commerce website or ordered it from Chroma. This was not expected from Amazon.\\n\\nFYI Amazon,\\nI'm already using 2 other laptops, they DO NOT heat\", 'I ordered the laptop and got delivery on 06 Oct 21 at 2000h. The laptop screen flickers and the laptop hangs. Five minutes into new laptop spending 92,290 and this experience spoils everything.\\nAsking for refund . Hopefully Amazon and LG respond', \"The product is good for it's price in India. Obviously it is almost 30k higher than what it is in the US but that's what most fo the laptop companies do in India. The tax diffrences are not that big to create such a price difference but unfortunately most of the companies use this tactics in India.\\n\\nHowever, coming to the laptop, this one of the best that I have experienced so far. I have dell, macbook, and Asus laptops in my family and I can certainly say that Dell has the best built among the all. However, LG has also done an incredibly great job with this laptop. I hoped that they could have provided a metal finishing aroud the screen as well. Rest all the things are fine.\\n\\nObviously, the specs are already mentioned, so I won't mention again. However note that the 17 inch screen is 16:10. And it is a 2k display. Based on the two, 80Wh battery gives around 8-10 hours of battery life with internet surfing and general work which is good considering screen size and resolution. You may lower the resolution to get better battery life but I did not like it after lowering the resolution and so kept it like that.\\n\\nAlso, the Ram and SSD are upgradable. I bought the 512/8 GB version. I upgraded to 1TB/16GB. NVMe SSD is supported. And Sodimm ram is supported. Ram is CL22 at 3200 MHz. So, I did not face any issues in performance either with 8 GB ram or 16 GB ram.\\n\\nGames are not playable as it does not have graphics card. However, I could still play some old games like Prototype 2 and Prince of Persia the two thrones.\\n\\nIt is mostly targeted for business users as most of the daily tasks can be done and is ultra portable. Video editing is also possible but 4k editing is a bit slow.\\n\\nSome people reported about heating issue which I also faced initially during charging but several updated later, I don't see that issue. It sometimes heats up during charging but not while using. Yes, it heats up during gaming as well but I'm personally not concerned about gaming as I didn't buy it for gaming. Though, if you are planning to buy a laptop for gaming,it is better to go for something with graphics card.\\n\\nCon - The only major con I found was that this has the trackpad in the middle with a full keyboard which makes typing difficult. The trackpad is usually placed below the space bar. However, once you start using it, you'll get used to it after a few days. It took me almost a month to get used to the key position and the backspace especially because my last laptop had only alphabetical keys. LG could have improved that by placing the alphabetical keyboard with speakers on the side. Numeric keys might be useful for number crunchers.\\n\\nOverall, I really liked the laptop, the build quality and screen is amazing to look at.\", \"I got it at 82990 , mainly for media consumption purpose , for that is perfect.\\nIt gets little bit heated at bottom. By default sound is very low but tune dts x app and sound will be perfect fine\\nDisplay is gorgeous with QHD+ and 16:10 display web pages look beautiful\\nConstruction quality is top notch and sturdy will little bit of flex in chassis which is understandable as it's 17 inch .\\nNo laptop bag or pouch is provided .\\nBezels are narrow .\\nBattery life is fantastic\\nKey caps are large\\nIt has 2 level of backlit\\nCharging is via type C port\\nTrackpad is large and super smooth\\nOverall enjoyed using laptop\", ' I am a Linux super user, from Ubuntu to CentOS to Arch I used almost everything and tried.

A handfull of laptop. Simply the best laptop computer I have used so far. Battery does not last as advertised. But I get a decent 10 plus hours backup. In the last one week, I charged it only twice. Screen is a very big plus. Very clear and nice display. I reduce the resolution to use my engineering drawings and bring it back to recommended setting after my work is done. We need to wait for all apps to catchup with this resolution. Keyboard and touchpad are fluid. Fingerprint is a breeze. Some bloatware found. I uninstalled some and kept some that that I felt is of use. Speakers are quite good. I read reviews and saw videos and was waiting for a disastrous sound. But the sound is quite good. Most importantly, we can hear a full surround sound from these two speakers. The spacing is such that it feels like listening through headphones due to the size of the laptop.\\n\\nI own many LG products, (refrigerator, washing machine, dishwasher) and now this laptop. No brand loyalty at all. But I do a research of the quality before buying, and end up buying an LG product.

Works better than my thinkpad and faster recognition\\n\\nCons:\\n* The charger could have been smaller but not a complaint\\n* Speakers are good and decent - not for someone who is looking for very high volume (not a con for me)\\n* Battery seems to be claiming 14 hours + but for me works for 7 hours roughly but that's still high and have to explore power saving options. (will update the review if there is any change)\\n\\nFor someone like me who works on numerous servers everyday this is a power packed machine which definitely meets my expectations.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

Some driver updates here and there resolved the issue for a while. It reappeared again after a week. But luckily by that time Windows 11 update became available for the model.

I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX.

NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM).

The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed.

Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho.

And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch. Only display didn't reach the expectation.\", \"Best possible clone of MacBook in your budget.\\n\\nI tried to install MacOS and shared this photo with my friends and they thought it was MacBook 😂\\nPros -\\n1) Metal build\\n2) Battery backup (my case 6-7hrs)\\n3) Display quality with 90hz performs really well for editing\\n4) Wi-Fi 6 has great connectivity and has thunderbolt 4 port\\n\\nCons-\\n1) It would be great if it come with Ryzen variant and 2gb graphics card\\n2) Intel iris xe donot performs well in high end games (tried watch dogs2)\\n3) the velcro for binding the charger wire is little small and can have problem while binding the wires\\n\\nOverall it is a good clone for MacBook which comes in a pocket.

Almost reflects like a mirror under certain lighting making it very difficult to watch movies, although the glare disappears at night while the room tubelight is on. Be prepared to install a screen guard if necessary\\n- LG inbuilt software not easily available. Download it from the LG USA site under the 14\" variant.

Make sure to uncheck DTS while updating through LG control centre)\\n- A bit expensive (92k for 11th gen i7 16 gb Ram 16\" variant)\\n- RAM is soldered, so no further addition possible.\\n- Thermal throttles very easily. The laptop is excellent for day to day tasks like watching movies, office work, browsing, etc but if you\\'re into a lot of cpu intensive tasks like compression, video editing, gaming then DO NOT buy this as it will immediately heat up and throttle and give very bad performance.\\n\\nOverall a good laptop.

The tax diffrences are not that big to create such a price difference but unfortunately most of the companies use this tactics in India.\\n\\nHowever, coming to the laptop, this one of the best that I have experienced so far. I have dell, macbook, and Asus laptops in my family and I can certainly say that Dell has the best built among the all. However, LG has also done an incredibly great job with this laptop. I hoped that they could have provided a metal finishing aroud the screen as well. Rest all the things are fine.\\n\\nObviously, the specs are already mentioned, so I won't mention again. However note that the 17 inch screen is 16:10. And it is a 2k display. Based on the two, 80Wh battery gives around 8-10 hours of battery life with internet surfing and general work which is good considering screen size and resolution. You may lower the resolution to get better battery life but I did not like it after lowering the resolution and so kept it like that.\\n\\nAlso, the Ram and SSD are upgradable. I bought the 512/8 GB version. I upgraded to 1TB/16GB. NVMe SSD is supported. And Sodimm ram is supported. Ram is CL22 at 3200 MHz. So, I did not face any issues in performance either with 8 GB ram or 16 GB ram.\\n\\nGames are not playable as it does not have graphics card. However, I could still play some old games like Prototype 2 and Prince of Persia the two thrones.\\n\\nIt is mostly targeted for business users as most of the daily tasks can be done and is ultra portable. Video editing is also possible but 4k editing is a bit slow.\\n\\nSome people reported about heating issue which I also faced initially during charging but several updated later, I don't see that issue. It sometimes heats up during charging but not while using. Yes, it heats up during gaming as well but I'm personally not concerned about gaming as I didn't buy it for gaming. Though, if you are planning to buy a laptop for gaming,it is better to go for something with graphics card.\\n\\nCon - The only major con I found was that this has the trackpad in the middle with a full keyboard which makes typing difficult. The trackpad is usually placed below the space bar. However, once you start using it, you'll get used to it after a few days. It took me almost a month to get used to the key position and the backspace especially because my last laptop had only alphabetical keys. LG could have improved that by placing the alphabetical keyboard with speakers on the side. Numeric keys might be useful for number crunchers.\\n\\nOverall, I really liked the laptop, the build quality and screen is amazing to look at.\", \"I got it at 82990 , mainly for media consumption purpose , for that is perfect.\\nIt gets little bit heated at bottom.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6.. Takes thin and light to the next level.. Have owned 2 Zenbooks before, this is lighter and with better build quality.. Hoping they do a good job on service as well..', \"I brought this Laptop 3 days back. Excellent product. Typical Japanese Design with Simplicity. The most advantage is you have full connectivity. You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

Tried all the software and driver reinstallation instructions available online with no success. Tried contacting the customer care number and got a message that the number or service doesn't exist. Called the local customer service point listed in Fujitsu site. Even that number is fake or incorrect. Looks like it is a scam. Product quality is pathetic. Speaker sounds like the one we get in local chor bazars. Kindly note that return and refund option is not available. You might get the same sub par product as a replacement even if you raise a complaint. Kindly avoid this product at any cost. I just lost around 90k of my hard earned money on this scam.\\n\\nUpdate on 9th Nov 2021\\nAfter a long conversation with Amazon support agent, I was able to connect to the support number published by Fujitsu. Looks like the message we hear when the line is busy is misleading. Once the call got through to Fujitsu support, things were pretty smooth. Support is handled by Lenovo India support team and the response was superb. The service personnel patiently attended to all the issues. Some driver updates here and there resolved the issue for a while. It reappeared again after a week. But luckily by that time Windows 11 update became available for the model. I upgraded successfully to Windows 11 and both Wifi and Bluetooth is working now. But not sure if the issue will pop up again after a while. Fingers crossed.\", 'Play Video\\n Help please.\\nI am not gettibg this ( yahoo mail) on full screen\\nRight click does not operate', 'Everything is good but its only 1.9GHZ not as mentioned in description 3.9GHZ overall budget best product best specs all rounder, perfomance is absolutely good, it came with ms office, getting i7 at this price is great deal', \"Writing this review after using it for 2 months. I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX. Its like playing on a GT 750 which is still better than not having a GPU in this chip shortage.\\n\\nIt comes with Intel NVMe which is almost twice faster than ordinary SSDs. Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time.

Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck.

I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop. This is a real bummer, the thunderbolt port also doesny charge the laptop.\\n\\nThe webcam and the speakers are also totally useless. So a video call was a disspointing experience.\\n\\nAnd the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me. All mi support could do was redirect me to a youtube video and microsoft directly. I wasn't able to work around the error msg: office home and student is not associated to your account. Hope it works for others.\\n\\nHappy with the build quality, display, wifi 6 and fast ports.\\nRest all is just gimick unless some miraculous software update can fix the speakers, webcam and charging options.\", \"Pros\\n\\nGreat price to value proposition.

Comfortable to type for long.\\n\\nUsable 720p camera for zoom/teams call. Disable digital video stabilization setting from camera app else there will be delay in video.\\n\\nClose to 10 hour battery backup after full charge. Battery drain also reasonable under normal workloads.

Use a wired or wireless headphone for voice capture.\\n\\nA bit on heavier side while picking up.May be due to the grade 6 sandblasted aluminium used.\\n\\nBacklight doesn't stay on. Goes off after sometime of inactivity and has to be renabled.

Buy it without a second thought.\", 'Read above rating as 4.5/5.\\n\\nUpgraded from an era old Hp Laptop. Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol. Another example after the iPhone 11 that proves higher resolution != better display.\\n\\nI have an old hp pavilion 14 x360 (14inch 1080p), LG 22MK600M monitor (22 inch IPS LCD 1080p), Lenovo L24i-30 monitor (24 inch IPS LCD 1080p) to compare with and have to say color reproduction is not at all natural on the Mi laptop. And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch. Only display didn't reach the expectation.\", \"Best possible clone of MacBook in your budget.\\n\\nI tried to install MacOS and shared this photo with my friends and they thought it was MacBook 😂\\nPros -\\n1) Metal build\\n2) Battery backup (my case 6-7hrs)\\n3) Display quality with 90hz performs really well for editing\\n4) Wi-Fi 6 has great connectivity and has thunderbolt 4 port\\n\\nCons-\\n1) It would be great if it come with Ryzen variant and 2gb graphics card\\n2) Intel iris xe donot performs well in high end games (tried watch dogs2)\\n3) the velcro for binding the charger wire is little small and can have problem while binding the wires\\n\\nOverall it is a good clone for MacBook which comes in a pocket.

But on 18th the option of chat contact was also closed (return window closed on 17th, - I did not understand the connection as the question is not about return)nor did I get any response through email.

They offered extended two years warranty at 6499 while the same plan if purchased from mi.com along with the laptop is 3699. I called mi customer care and the reason given was since you have purchased from Amazon, our partners can't provide you at the same rate and you should have bought from mi.com. Why is this not mentioned in Amazon or mi website as a disclaimer. I felt really cheated and this is not what I expected from Amazon nor Xiaomi.\\nUpdating after using for three months.

It's been three weeks and no one called back after checking the issue. When I called they are saying motherhood issue and they have ordered the part and the company is not sending the part.

I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price.

The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX. Its like playing on a GT 750 which is still better than not having a GPU in this chip shortage.\\n\\nIt comes with Intel NVMe which is almost twice faster than ordinary SSDs. Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time.

The tax diffrences are not that big to create such a price difference but unfortunately most of the companies use this tactics in India.\\n\\nHowever, coming to the laptop, this one of the best that I have experienced so far. I have dell, macbook, and Asus laptops in my family and I can certainly say that Dell has the best built among the all. However, LG has also done an incredibly great job with this laptop. I hoped that they could have provided a metal finishing aroud the screen as well. Rest all the things are fine.\\n\\nObviously, the specs are already mentioned, so I won't mention again. However note that the 17 inch screen is 16:10. And it is a 2k display. Based on the two, 80Wh battery gives around 8-10 hours of battery life with internet surfing and general work which is good considering screen size and resolution. You may lower the resolution to get better battery life but I did not like it after lowering the resolution and so kept it like that.\\n\\nAlso, the Ram and SSD are upgradable. I bought the 512/8 GB version. I upgraded to 1TB/16GB. NVMe SSD is supported. And Sodimm ram is supported. Ram is CL22 at 3200 MHz. So, I did not face any issues in performance either with 8 GB ram or 16 GB ram.\\n\\nGames are not playable as it does not have graphics card.

It sometimes heats up during charging but not while using. Yes, it heats up during gaming as well but I'm personally not concerned about gaming as I didn't buy it for gaming. Though, if you are planning to buy a laptop for gaming,it is better to go for something with graphics card.\\n\\nCon - The only major con I found was that this has the trackpad in the middle with a full keyboard which makes typing difficult. The trackpad is usually placed below the space bar. However, once you start using it, you'll get used to it after a few days. It took me almost a month to get used to the key position and the backspace especially because my last laptop had only alphabetical keys. LG could have improved that by placing the alphabetical keyboard with speakers on the side. Numeric keys might be useful for number crunchers.\\n\\nOverall, I really liked the laptop, the build quality and screen is amazing to look at.\", \"I got it at 82990 , mainly for media consumption purpose , for that is perfect.\\nIt gets little bit heated at bottom.

Inspite being a Linux fan I was trapped with MacOS for last 4 years because of performance.\\nNow I gifted freedom of open source again to me without compromising system requirements.\\nIn video I compared Android studio execution of same project in emulator on Gram and MacBook Air mid 2014 (running on Nvme PCIe M.2 SSD). LG was very fast than MacOS. Android emu opened in less than 5 seconds. Is mind blowing.\\n\\nI also made my linux look like MacOS with kde and it works awesome.\\n\\nDisplay will impress you a lot and I loved it.\\n\\nThe sound system (speakers) sucks. LG probably added small sized speakers to keep less weight but since I use external speakers I do not have much problem with it.\\n\\nThe camera is ok. Not best.\\nGo for it only if you are a programmer and Linux enthusiasts.\\nGamers keep away.', 'I have gaming 3 screen setup at home and bought this one to replace my macbook 13\" for travel and work.\\nPros :-\\n1. Amazing battery life( Above 12 hours everytime I used it and even more).\\n2. Screen size with 16:10 so much extra space.\\n3. Screen quality and color accuracy on this thing is amazing.\\n4. Able to use VScode for frontend with multiple browsers with multiple tabs open without any lag.\\n5. Was able to run linux/Ubuntu WSL2 on windows for running my projects.\\n6. Upgrade to windows 11 and everything feels much better now.\\n7. Keyboard keys are wide which helped in typing accuracy above 96% most of the time.\\n8. Camera for video calls is good enough.\\n9. Speakers on this is good enough please set the music mode to automatic in dts:x settings.\\n10. So light no words.\\n11. Amazing texture and look of the laptop.\\n\\nCons -\\n1.

So this ticks all my boxes. Battery life is very good not 19 hours as they mention but 10 hours on regular use is more than good for me on 17 inch qhd panel. Screen is fabulous. Wish lg did something to reduce the reflection of the panel. Ram is soldered not upgradable but 8 gb is enough for my trading needs. Ssd can be upgraded with additional m.2 slot.\\nThose who know. They just buy gram . Its a premium device and was priced sensibly during launch.', 'LG Gram 17\" with its 11th Gen i7 Processor, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD comes as a good package especially when its under Rs.1 lakh (inclusive of Taxes).

There is a bit of distortion at high volume.\\nNot a glass Trackpad but its pretty smooth.\\nIf you're using it for browsing, documents, light games, etc it works fine without any issue. Starts lagging a bit if you do heavy graphic tasks or large video editing. It kinda starts giving up(but hey it wasn't meant for those tasks either)\\nI was looking for a light &slim laptop with a nice display& good performance. This one ticks all of them and that too at a fair price.\\nAsus, acer do have light ones but they come with small screen and are expensive.\\n\\nGRAB IT WHILE YOU CAN!!!!\\nIt is worth every penny spent.\", 'Cant ask for more. A handfull of laptop. Simply the best laptop computer I have used so far. Battery does not last as advertised. But I get a decent 10 plus hours backup. In the last one week, I charged it only twice. Screen is a very big plus. Very clear and nice display. I reduce the resolution to use my engineering drawings and bring it back to recommended setting after my work is done. We need to wait for all apps to catchup with this resolution. Keyboard and touchpad are fluid. Fingerprint is a breeze. Some bloatware found. I uninstalled some and kept some that that I felt is of use. Speakers are quite good. I read reviews and saw videos and was waiting for a disastrous sound. But the sound is quite good. Most importantly, we can hear a full surround sound from these two speakers. The spacing is such that it feels like listening through headphones due to the size of the laptop.\\n\\nI own many LG products, (refrigerator, washing machine, dishwasher) and now this laptop. No brand loyalty at all. But I do a research of the quality before buying, and end up buying an LG product. (My TV is a different brand)\\n\\nI believe the 2021 model is even better.', \"First of all I am using this as my primary laptop for my work for the last 5 days. Let me try to give a detailsed review from what I see.\\n\\nPros:\\n* Didn't expect the machine to be this light. Light as feather.\\n* Man, the screen quality is awesome (yes it ia reflective) but considering the quality its great.\\n* Keypad is cool amd is backlit\\n* Has two Thunderbolt ports acts based on the input - Charging, Data transfer, LAN, etc....\\n* The screen is not wobbling as others described and is sturdy (no worries if fan is on)\\n* Neat and premium finish\\n* Fingerprint is just awesome. Works better than my thinkpad and faster recognition\\n\\nCons:\\n* The charger could have been smaller but not a complaint\\n* Speakers are good and decent - not for someone who is looking for very high volume (not a con for me)\\n* Battery seems to be claiming 14 hours + but for me works for 7 hours roughly but that's still high and have to explore power saving options. (will update the review if there is any change)\\n\\nFor someone like me who works on numerous servers everyday this is a power packed machine which definitely meets my expectations. This is a great upgrade from Thinkpad. Don't think twice - grab this beauty and you wont regret at all.\", 'Single hand open is the best!!\\nLarge screen with Quality sound!\\nThe best laptop is you are a light user, strongly suggested for Manager or any Business persons who were mostly in between calls.\\nNot for gamers\\nNot for Software engineers.', 'I didnt know that LG also makes laptop. When I saw they are making 17\" laptops for a decent price I decided to give it a try.\\n1. Its super light weight, lighter than MacBook pro. It was a great surprise.\\n2. Its also very thin making it very easy to handle.\\n3. It has full keyboard which is a great plus but the layout is bit inconvenient and takes time to adjust\\n4. The speaker are located at the bottom and dont sound that great, if you want a laptop for playing music/movies dont depend on these speakers.\\n5.The internals are good, the speed is fine, I haven\\'t tested it with a 3D software or Video editing software yet, so dont know how it will perform.\\n6. The default memory is 8G and you cant upgrade/customize it on amazon while buying it, you have to buy it from a 3rd party source which is a hassle.\\n7. The fingerprint login is a great, no need to use passwords anymore\\n8. Only one USB-C/Thunderbolt port, and 3 USB ports. I would have liked more USBC/Thunderbolt ports.\\n9. No ethernet port but they give your the USBC to ethernet adapter with it.\\n10. It has Intel\\'s graphics card, which is generally not as good as NVIDIA\\'s or AMD\\'s but does perform well.\\n\\nSummary : If you want a bg screen, lightweight thin laptop, this one fits the bill. the specs are decent for a general purpose laptop. I dont expect it to perform well for applications where a great performing graphics/CPU is needed.', 'Got it 4 days ago. Light weight. Be cautious while working on it by the side of a window…it may fall due to the air coming in. Audio is a little less due to positioning of the speakers beneath the base.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6.. Takes thin and light to the next level.. Have owned 2 Zenbooks before, this is lighter and with better build quality.. Hoping they do a good job on service as well..', \"I brought this Laptop 3 days back. Excellent product. Typical Japanese Design with Simplicity. The most advantage is you have full connectivity. You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2.

For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM).

Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.\\n\\nLow sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.\", \"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop.

So a video call was a disspointing experience.\\n\\nAnd the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me.

Have to rely on usb cables.\\n\\nNo dedicated number keys even though laptop is a 15.6 inch one. Would have been better to have dedicated number keys while working on excel.\\n\\nVoice capture using inbuilt microphone not the loudest. Use a wired or wireless headphone for voice capture.\\n\\nA bit on heavier side while picking up.May be due to the grade 6 sandblasted aluminium used.\\n\\nBacklight doesn't stay on.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol.

And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch.

Make sure to uncheck DTS while updating through LG control centre)\\n- A bit expensive (92k for 11th gen i7 16 gb Ram 16\" variant)\\n- RAM is soldered, so no further addition possible.\\n- Thermal throttles very easily. The laptop is excellent for day to day tasks like watching movies, office work, browsing, etc but if you\\'re into a lot of cpu intensive tasks like compression, video editing, gaming then DO NOT buy this as it will immediately heat up and throttle and give very bad performance.\\n\\nOverall a good laptop. Couldn\\'t give 5 stars due to its poor cooling, screen glare and high price.\\n\\nPro tip : If you\\'re only doing office work, browsing or movie watching, I\\'d suggest you put it in battery saver mode all the time. I could easily get about 12 hours of backup doing this without any performance hit.\\n\\nEdit 1 : After a month of usage, I must say I\\'m getting used to the glare. I just set the brightness to max while watching movies during daytime, and even though I can still see the reflection of my face on the screen like a mirror, I\\'m learning to ignore it.', 'One if the most innovative products available in the market\\n\\nNormally any laptop above 14inch is either budget product or a premium mobile workstation costing upwards of lakhs and compromised mobility.\\n\\nLG gram 16 is one of the few machines which is not a MacBook ripoff . With a large form factor and light weight it offers best of both the worlds.\\n\\nFew points :\\n\\n1.Weight & Mobility : 10/10\\n2. Dimensions of 16 inches in form factor of a standard 15.6 inch laptop.\\n2. Intel Evo certified performance is butter smooth even for CAD and photoshop works : 10/10\\n3. Good quality keyboard and touchpad\\n4. Screen Quality -10/10\\n5. Buid Quality -20/10 (Superb, no loose ends it’s perfect fit and finish )\\n6. Battery life -4/10 ( Against 22 hour claim I am getting 4-5 hours)\\n7. Keyboard and Touchpad -10/10', \"Yes it's too light weight. But the screen and it's bank build quality is low as it's not sturdy. Battery backup is of max 8 -10 hrs depending on usage.\", 'I liked everything about the laptop and its display is really cool and its handy and easy to carry around', \"Cons first,\\n-Utterly waste speakers.\\n-Reflective screen. Can't use it even when there is a little light.\\n\\nI bought it mainly for productivity work, but these cons are annoying. Come on, why Reflective screen? At this price is disappointment.\", 'Performance was good. With in 10 days only one USB port not working. It seems the build quality is poor. Now I am getting doubt on other parts also like the as USB.', \"Bought the product twice the first one had touchpad issue where it didn't work on lap.\\nAsked for replacement but Amazon refused it and refunded the amount had to order new one. Second one that I received had display issue where the light was bleeding. Again asked for replacement but Amazon refused again and are refunding the amount. Loosing the discount which is clearly bad policy from amazon. Overall laptop is very light weight but performance on i7 with 16gb just satisfactory as LG reserve it to 15w TDP.\\nCompared to i7 from HP or Lenevo performance is just about ok.\", '**Update**\\nAfter 3 weeks of usage the laptop display became faulty. LG has THE worst customer (or should I say, non-existent) service. There is no service personnel assigned after a week of raising complaint in the online portal. After several follow-ups, LG assigned a service agent who asked if my \"fridge\" needs to be repaired, followed by another agent asking if my \"washing machine\" needs to be repaired. I finally gave up and requested Amazon for a refund. I am thankful that Amazon has agreed.\\n\\nGot the i7 model, 16GB RAM during the Diwali sale. For the cost, this offers the best value for money wrt to high end specs. HP, Dell, Lenovo costs slightly higher for same or similar configuration.\\n\\nPros:\\n+ Light weight\\n+ Snappy performance\\n+ Awesome keyboard\\n+ Responsive trackpad & FP scanner\\n+ Crisp FHD display\\n+ Silent\\n+ 3 years warranty\\n\\nCons:\\n- Speakers\\n- Plasticy and bendy\\n- Doesnt look premium\\n- Battery doesnt last more than 6-7 hrs (i upgraded to Win 11 Pro N)\\n\\nI am happy with the laptop, though I wonder if Mi Laptop Pro for similar configuration but almost 10K less would have been better value for money.', 'Screen is too reflective to work. Numpad has wrong positioning of decimal and zero. Not reommended for people who use NUM pad.', \"I had put this laptop for chrge since 1.5 hours, and it still not even charged 15%\\nAnd its heating like an hell, the sound quality is very very very bad of this PC, and even the charger is heated upto 250+ °C\\nI have been using my dell laptop since 6+ years, and never face such issue.\\n\\n*Update:*\\nI got the product replaced, after soo many calls and tracks, pathetic delivery experience.\\nEven in the replaced product same issue but at this time even without putting laptop on charge it was heating, I asked for replacement but they're not replacing, instead they are refinding my money. Now have some brains and tell me, I ordered this product along with other items whose total cost was around 1.5L and I got some cashbacks while ordering for more than 1L amount, now if they refund my money, they'll deduct all my cashbacks that I've got, and it'll totally be useless shopping for me. This was their mistake that they delivered me bad product twice with the worst delivery experience and because of them, I need to suffer with my cashbacks and credit amount. This is totally unacceptable. Awaiting for callback from the tech team, and it's totally a problem from Amazon's end not from my end. I am purchasing a product worth more than 92k I can't just accept it whatever they give. They've kept all the damaged product at amazon. I have been a regular customer of Amazon since more than 5-6 years, it would have been better if I had chose some.other e-commerce website or ordered it from Chroma. This was not expected from Amazon.\\n\\nFYI Amazon,\\nI'm already using 2 other laptops, they DO NOT heat\", 'I ordered the laptop and got delivery on 06 Oct 21 at 2000h. The laptop screen flickers and the laptop hangs. Five minutes into new laptop spending 92,290 and this experience spoils everything.\\nAsking for refund . Hopefully Amazon and LG respond', \"The product is good for it's price in India. Obviously it is almost 30k higher than what it is in the US but that's what most fo the laptop companies do in India. The tax diffrences are not that big to create such a price difference but unfortunately most of the companies use this tactics in India.\\n\\nHowever, coming to the laptop, this one of the best that I have experienced so far. I have dell, macbook, and Asus laptops in my family and I can certainly say that Dell has the best built among the all. However, LG has also done an incredibly great job with this laptop. I hoped that they could have provided a metal finishing aroud the screen as well. Rest all the things are fine.\\n\\nObviously, the specs are already mentioned, so I won't mention again. However note that the 17 inch screen is 16:10. And it is a 2k display. Based on the two, 80Wh battery gives around 8-10 hours of battery life with internet surfing and general work which is good considering screen size and resolution. You may lower the resolution to get better battery life but I did not like it after lowering the resolution and so kept it like that.\\n\\nAlso, the Ram and SSD are upgradable. I bought the 512/8 GB version. I upgraded to 1TB/16GB. NVMe SSD is supported. And Sodimm ram is supported. Ram is CL22 at 3200 MHz. So, I did not face any issues in performance either with 8 GB ram or 16 GB ram.\\n\\nGames are not playable as it does not have graphics card. However, I could still play some old games like Prototype 2 and Prince of Persia the two thrones.\\n\\nIt is mostly targeted for business users as most of the daily tasks can be done and is ultra portable. Video editing is also possible but 4k editing is a bit slow.\\n\\nSome people reported about heating issue which I also faced initially during charging but several updated later, I don't see that issue. It sometimes heats up during charging but not while using. Yes, it heats up during gaming as well but I'm personally not concerned about gaming as I didn't buy it for gaming. Though, if you are planning to buy a laptop for gaming,it is better to go for something with graphics card.\\n\\nCon - The only major con I found was that this has the trackpad in the middle with a full keyboard which makes typing difficult. The trackpad is usually placed below the space bar. However, once you start using it, you'll get used to it after a few days. It took me almost a month to get used to the key position and the backspace especially because my last laptop had only alphabetical keys. LG could have improved that by placing the alphabetical keyboard with speakers on the side. Numeric keys might be useful for number crunchers.\\n\\nOverall, I really liked the laptop, the build quality and screen is amazing to look at.\", \"I got it at 82990 , mainly for media consumption purpose , for that is perfect.\\nIt gets little bit heated at bottom. By default sound is very low but tune dts x app and sound will be perfect fine\\nDisplay is gorgeous with QHD+ and 16:10 display web pages look beautiful\\nConstruction quality is top notch and sturdy will little bit of flex in chassis which is understandable as it's 17 inch .\\nNo laptop bag or pouch is provided .\\nBezels are narrow .\\nBattery life is fantastic\\nKey caps are large\\nIt has 2 level of backlit\\nCharging is via type C port\\nTrackpad is large and super smooth\\nOverall enjoyed using laptop\", ' I am a Linux super user, from Ubuntu to CentOS to Arch I used almost everything and tried. I rate this machine awesome for progammers and enthusiast like me. Inspite being a Linux fan I was trapped with MacOS for last 4 years because of performance.\\nNow I gifted freedom of open source again to me without compromising system requirements.\\nIn video I compared Android studio execution of same project in emulator on Gram and MacBook Air mid 2014 (running on Nvme PCIe M.2 SSD). LG was very fast than MacOS. Android emu opened in less than 5 seconds. Is mind blowing.\\n\\nI also made my linux look like MacOS with kde and it works awesome.\\n\\nDisplay will impress you a lot and I loved it.\\n\\nThe sound system (speakers) sucks. LG probably added small sized speakers to keep less weight but since I use external speakers I do not have much problem with it.\\n\\nThe camera is ok. Not best.\\nGo for it only if you are a programmer and Linux enthusiasts.\\nGamers keep away.', 'I have gaming 3 screen setup at home and bought this one to replace my macbook 13\" for travel and work.\\nPros :-\\n1.

A handfull of laptop. Simply the best laptop computer I have used so far. Battery does not last as advertised. But I get a decent 10 plus hours backup. In the last one week, I charged it only twice. Screen is a very big plus. Very clear and nice display. I reduce the resolution to use my engineering drawings and bring it back to recommended setting after my work is done. We need to wait for all apps to catchup with this resolution. Keyboard and touchpad are fluid. Fingerprint is a breeze. Some bloatware found. I uninstalled some and kept some that that I felt is of use. Speakers are quite good. I read reviews and saw videos and was waiting for a disastrous sound. But the sound is quite good. Most importantly, we can hear a full surround sound from these two speakers. The spacing is such that it feels like listening through headphones due to the size of the laptop.\\n\\nI own many LG products, (refrigerator, washing machine, dishwasher) and now this laptop. No brand loyalty at all. But I do a research of the quality before buying, and end up buying an LG product. (My TV is a different brand)\\n\\nI believe the 2021 model is even better.', \"First of all I am using this as my primary laptop for my work for the last 5 days. Let me try to give a detailsed review from what I see.\\n\\nPros:\\n* Didn't expect the machine to be this light. Light as feather.\\n* Man, the screen quality is awesome (yes it ia reflective) but considering the quality its great.\\n* Keypad is cool amd is backlit\\n* Has two Thunderbolt ports acts based on the input - Charging, Data transfer, LAN, etc....\\n* The screen is not wobbling as others described and is sturdy (no worries if fan is on)\\n* Neat and premium finish\\n* Fingerprint is just awesome. Works better than my thinkpad and faster recognition\\n\\nCons:\\n* The charger could have been smaller but not a complaint\\n* Speakers are good and decent - not for someone who is looking for very high volume (not a con for me)\\n* Battery seems to be claiming 14 hours + but for me works for 7 hours roughly but that's still high and have to explore power saving options. (will update the review if there is any change)\\n\\nFor someone like me who works on numerous servers everyday this is a power packed machine which definitely meets my expectations. This is a great upgrade from Thinkpad. Don't think twice - grab this beauty and you wont regret at all.\", 'Single hand open is the best!!\\nLarge screen with Quality sound!\\nThe best laptop is you are a light user, strongly suggested for Manager or any Business persons who were mostly in between calls.\\nNot for gamers\\nNot for Software engineers.', 'I didnt know that LG also makes laptop. When I saw they are making 17\" laptops for a decent price I decided to give it a try.\\n1. Its super light weight, lighter than MacBook pro. It was a great surprise.\\n2. Its also very thin making it very easy to handle.\\n3. It has full keyboard which is a great plus but the layout is bit inconvenient and takes time to adjust\\n4. The speaker are located at the bottom and dont sound that great, if you want a laptop for playing music/movies dont depend on these speakers.\\n5.The internals are good, the speed is fine, I haven\\'t tested it with a 3D software or Video editing software yet, so dont know how it will perform.\\n6. The default memory is 8G and you cant upgrade/customize it on amazon while buying it, you have to buy it from a 3rd party source which is a hassle.\\n7. The fingerprint login is a great, no need to use passwords anymore\\n8. Only one USB-C/Thunderbolt port, and 3 USB ports. I would have liked more USBC/Thunderbolt ports.\\n9. No ethernet port but they give your the USBC to ethernet adapter with it.\\n10. It has Intel\\'s graphics card, which is generally not as good as NVIDIA\\'s or AMD\\'s but does perform well.\\n\\nSummary : If you want a bg screen, lightweight thin laptop, this one fits the bill. the specs are decent for a general purpose laptop. I dont expect it to perform well for applications where a great performing graphics/CPU is needed.', 'Got it 4 days ago. Light weight. Be cautious while working on it by the side of a window…it may fall due to the air coming in. Audio is a little less due to positioning of the speakers beneath the base.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6..

You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body.

The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed.

Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to some\\n\\nOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.\", \"Looks great, super display and quite fast so far.\\n\\nBig disspointment is the charger and charging.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking.

Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly.

I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated.

Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch.

Almost reflects like a mirror under certain lighting making it very difficult to watch movies, although the glare disappears at night while the room tubelight is on. Be prepared to install a screen guard if necessary\\n- LG inbuilt software not easily available. Download it from the LG USA site under the 14\" variant. Don\\'t install any software other than LG updater and LG control centre (installed DTS but it messed up my audio. Make sure to uncheck DTS while updating through LG control centre)\\n- A bit expensive (92k for 11th gen i7 16 gb Ram 16\" variant)\\n- RAM is soldered, so no further addition possible.\\n- Thermal throttles very easily. The laptop is excellent for day to day tasks like watching movies, office work, browsing, etc but if you\\'re into a lot of cpu intensive tasks like compression, video editing, gaming then DO NOT buy this as it will immediately heat up and throttle and give very bad performance.\\n\\nOverall a good laptop. Couldn\\'t give 5 stars due to its poor cooling, screen glare and high price.\\n\\nPro tip : If you\\'re only doing office work, browsing or movie watching, I\\'d suggest you put it in battery saver mode all the time.

Hopefully Amazon and LG respond', \"The product is good for it's price in India. Obviously it is almost 30k higher than what it is in the US but that's what most fo the laptop companies do in India. The tax diffrences are not that big to create such a price difference but unfortunately most of the companies use this tactics in India.\\n\\nHowever, coming to the laptop, this one of the best that I have experienced so far. I have dell, macbook, and Asus laptops in my family and I can certainly say that Dell has the best built among the all. However, LG has also done an incredibly great job with this laptop. I hoped that they could have provided a metal finishing aroud the screen as well. Rest all the things are fine.\\n\\nObviously, the specs are already mentioned, so I won't mention again. However note that the 17 inch screen is 16:10. And it is a 2k display. Based on the two, 80Wh battery gives around 8-10 hours of battery life with internet surfing and general work which is good considering screen size and resolution. You may lower the resolution to get better battery life but I did not like it after lowering the resolution and so kept it like that.\\n\\nAlso, the Ram and SSD are upgradable. I bought the 512/8 GB version. I upgraded to 1TB/16GB. NVMe SSD is supported. And Sodimm ram is supported. Ram is CL22 at 3200 MHz. So, I did not face any issues in performance either with 8 GB ram or 16 GB ram.\\n\\nGames are not playable as it does not have graphics card. However, I could still play some old games like Prototype 2 and Prince of Persia the two thrones.\\n\\nIt is mostly targeted for business users as most of the daily tasks can be done and is ultra portable. Video editing is also possible but 4k editing is a bit slow.\\n\\nSome people reported about heating issue which I also faced initially during charging but several updated later, I don't see that issue. It sometimes heats up during charging but not while using. Yes, it heats up during gaming as well but I'm personally not concerned about gaming as I didn't buy it for gaming. Though, if you are planning to buy a laptop for gaming,it is better to go for something with graphics card.\\n\\nCon - The only major con I found was that this has the trackpad in the middle with a full keyboard which makes typing difficult. The trackpad is usually placed below the space bar. However, once you start using it, you'll get used to it after a few days. It took me almost a month to get used to the key position and the backspace especially because my last laptop had only alphabetical keys. LG could have improved that by placing the alphabetical keyboard with speakers on the side. Numeric keys might be useful for number crunchers.\\n\\nOverall, I really liked the laptop, the build quality and screen is amazing to look at.\", \"I got it at 82990 , mainly for media consumption purpose , for that is perfect.\\nIt gets little bit heated at bottom.

      "[\"This is possibly going to be a game changer. My husband has been using the Fujitsu Lifebook A555 (a laptop he bought off Amazon in under INR 22K) for over 3 years now. The laptop still looks and feels like new, he runs it off Linux and has replaced the optical drive with a SSD. So when we started looking for a laptop replacement for me he suggested looking at the UHX.\\n\\nI was going to get an iPad Pro however this has been a better buy by miles. The form factor is similar, it has a keyboard in place and the power that Fujitsu has packed into this small form factor is absolutely insane. I am a Fujitsu fan girl for life now. I use a similar ideapad for office and this is going to be the home use laptop.\\n\\nThe minimalism that the no frills exterior of the laptop exudes is deceptive. They have packed in everything you could ever need and more into this sleek frame, even a space age RJ45 (for when you want to graduate to a better connection from the wifi to the wired).\\n\\nThe laptop comes with a registered Windows installation and MS Office 2019 as well. There was a small hiccup with the Office registtration which got resolved just by calling the 1800 support number within 24 hours (seems microsoft needed to hook up some wires in the backend on their registration service).\\n\\nFrom the looks of it this is going to be good for the next 3-5 years at least before it needs an upgrade again. It is sleek however it exudes sturdiness. I would not recommend the convertible for the simple reason that I felt that the folded over keyboard would mean keys keep getting depressed while you're holding and using the device. However if you have a use case for the touch screen/convertible by all means go ahead I'm sure that too will be as good as the simple laptop.\\n\\nUpdate: while there is nothing wrong with a Made in China label there are people out there who feel it is. For those people I have uploaded the asset tag from the back of the laptop. Clearly says Made in Japan.\\n\\nUpdate: the laptop comes with a regular SSD not an nvme. This is by no means a problem speeds are excellent and given the slim chasis you are anyway going to suffer severe heating up if you start playing heavy-duty games on this machine. The machine is meant to be a serious work laptop and it does that job excellently.\", \"This is really cool laptop with top notch performance. I found it easy to handle. The laptop stays calm, not much heat produced even when I had STS, Teams, Chrome and some more pgms. running together. My office laptop (Thinkpad T480) used to show some heat near the touch pad area also which is not the case with this laptop (the heat is recognizable near the function key array area)\\n\\n+ Battery charge is really coming more than 10 hrs. with moderate use\\n+ Finger print sensor is good. It works from the power on start time itself. If the finger print is identified and you start the laptop it gets into OS without any further intervention (even if you have multiple user account)\\n+ The screen color and brightness combination is good. Though at time I see the screen is giving some extra dim/brightness without any change in light ambience around me\\n\\nI usually use a product for a long time by as much as repair or find replacement items :).\\n^ The battery in this laptop is not repleaceable. I don't know how long the bettery perform of the same potential. There is no clarity when Fujitsu's service will be in India and how to avail. Though I know while buying but still...\\n^ The charging adapter - The laptop supported/suggested power adaptor should be made available in Amazon/ecom sites by Fujitsu\\n^ The webcam privacy shutter is very tiny. It's very tough to change using your finger muscle. You need to apply the nail pinch and I feel I am giving lot of strength while doing so\\n^ The Windows Home is not really enough for Pros. Virtualization is not availale ootb. May need to follow some other routes\\n^ The sound is really good and vibrant. But when I have 70+ volume I feel the treble in all over the laptop (on the keys, mouse touchpad too :D)\\n^ A compatible sleave/bag is necessary to maintain this laptop\", \"I have been using Fujitsu UH-X 11th (i7) generation for the past 1 month now. I found this laptop super lightweight, great device to multitask without any lag. I got Windows 10, but within 2 days I got the update for Windows 11.\\nAll my files were easily available as I had Microsoft One drive. It was an easy transition from my earlier laptop. The charge was super fast and it has pretty good battery life expectancy as well( stayed upto 5 hours even after my online session on Teams) . The battery gets slightly heated when you're performing multiple tasks and charging at the same time but not to worry it's been a overall wholesome and surprising experience so far. I definitely recommend this laptop if anyone is interested in a compact, decent and well priced laptop compared to other well known brand competitors at this price. The USP of this laptop is the light weight (less than 1kg) and highly efficient!\", 'If you have the budget and want a no nonsense super portable laptop for work, fujitsu has built a trend setting product that ticks all the boxes :)\\n\\nAll the ports you need and more, webcam shutter, great specs, great build quality, nice keyboard/track pad, Wifi 6.. Takes thin and light to the next level.. Have owned 2 Zenbooks before, this is lighter and with better build quality.. Hoping they do a good job on service as well..', \"I brought this Laptop 3 days back. Excellent product. Typical Japanese Design with Simplicity. The most advantage is you have full connectivity. You don't require special adaptor to convert into HDMI or USB like other high End Laptop. The laptop is surprisingly very much light in weight. The keyboard design is again excellent as if we are using Desktop. Very good choice at this price. The only laptop brand manufactured in Japan\", \"Simple design. Sleek looks. Light weight. But above all, super-smooth performance. I'm not into gaming and so I can't comment on how well it performs in that area. Other than that, it is a fantastic performer. Special mention for the keyboard buttons. Superb.\", 'Excellent product and very light weight.', 'Product Quality is good. Smooth and overall laptop design and build quality is good.', 'Very good', ' It is very nice', \"* The laptop is small and light as advertised. In fact it weighs only 850gms on my digital weighing scale, instead of the advertised 878 gms.\\n* It’s fast and operates smoothly without any issues, so far.\\n* 13.3” Display is crisp & clear and adequately bright. Though I feel 14” would been a better option for a marginal increase in weight/ size.\\n* Keyboard has nice feel and very comfortable to type.\\n* Laptop comes with many ports including SD card reader and LAN port, which is rare for laptops of this size.\\n* Battery charges really fast as advertised, with the supplied USB-C 65W charger (picture attached).\\n* 2 in 1 Power click button, which looks only like a finger print reader, is very convenient for one touch power on & authentication.\\n* The Low Power 16GB RAM actually runs at speeds of 4267MHz as seen in the task manager>performance>memory. It’s soldered on the motherboard and you cannot add any more RAM.\\n* It has only 512GB HDD option (available space is 472GB). It’s PCIe based SSD, and as per the tech specs it supports only upto 512GB. But I feel it should easily support 1TB as offered on their convertible model. Waiting for support to confirm on this.\\n* Battery last only 5-6 hours max. Not 10 hours as advertised.\\n* There is slight heating (41-43 deg C) in area above the function keys when running some applications like virus scan etc. But since this has metal body, it may helping to dissipate heat from inside, which is good for the laptop in the long run.\\n* The “ergo lift” is very marginal and all the air intake vents are underneath the laptop. Also the air outlet blows directly on to the lower bezel of the screen.\\n* Webcam and speaker is average, nothing much to expect I guess.\\n* The magnesium-lithium alloy body makes it very light and sturdy. But the colour/ finish is not smooth. It’s also a finger print magnet. (Picture attached). Not sure if this a property of the alloy?\\n* There's a gap between the lower bezel and screen. (Picture attached).\\nNot sure if this condition could deteriorate over time with usage and cause physical damage to screen/ pixels, with opening/ closing the laptop so many times in a day, as the action slightly flexes the lower bezel. Such damage may not be covered under warranty. Also, dust can settle inside through the gap and be an eye sore or create issues? Customer support says that this gap issue is normal for all laptops of this model. So I have asked them to send me pictures of other laptops showing similar gap. Will update if and when received. Does anyone else have this issue? According to me this is not normal but a design flaw. I had specifically gone for metal body design as my previous laptop’s hinge mounting base (plastic) had crumbled in 2 years. So I am disappointed.\\n* But customer support is always eager to help, with prompt replies/ updates. They sorted out my Office H&S 2019 activation issue, as I was having a previous H&S 2016 version in my MS account.\\n\\n#Update – 9th Aug.\\n* Customer support has reverted with picture of a demo laptop (same model) which shows the gap between lower bezel and screen. So this is a design issue.\\n* Another issue that I have noticed is that the internal NVMe 512MB HDD has very slow write speeds of only 276mbps. System Information shows this is a Samsung P991 (MZVLQ512HALU-00007) and as per Samsung's website, it’s supposed to give 1200mpbs write speeds. Have attached screenshot of the benchmark test. Read speed is OK. Cannot find any drivers on Fujitsu website. Even after entering my serial no., the laptop does not show up, though I had registered it on 29th July. Have contacted customer care and awaiting their resolution.\\n\\nUpdate: 01 Sep\\nCustomer care has been following up with me for the HDD write speed issue, and advised me to reset my device to factory defaults, as they didn't find any issues on their machines. They had sent screenshots to support their claim. Factory reset was not an option for me, as I couldn't afford any downtime. But this prompted me to try some windows settings on my laptop. Disabling device encryption seemed to have solved the issue, but only temporarily. Then I tried disabling all startup programs and enabling them again. This seemed to have helped so far, and my write speeds are now as expected. Picture attached.\\nThe main drawbacks of laptop are 1. Battery lasts only half the time advertised. 2. Finish/ texture is not smooth and attracts lot of finger prints 3. The lower bezel has a gap between screen. But this should not have any effect on functionality, as I understand the bezels are the only plastic (ABS) parts in the full alloy body. So the LCD display will be mounted firmly on top alloy cover (A).\\nI have now revised rating from 3 to 4 star.\", \"No doubt it has the best configuration (not for gamers) at price(76682 @ amazon sale).\\n\\nFirst I would like to mention that the speakers are not good, I mean you must use headphones.\\n***Made in Japan***\\nBest things are - Weight, Display, Performance - great, TPM is super fast\\nCame with Windows 10 Home(just tried with Windows 10 Pro upgrade for bit locker encryption) and then upgraded to Windows 11 today to give a try & MS Office 2019 Student edition - So cool.\\nHP Inktank 310 printer didn't work with HP Smart Service app(You must download the drivers and install to enable the printer).\\nIt comes with C-Type Charger(I use AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C Multiport Adapter) to connect to monitor which serves charging as well.\\nOther USB drives worked (Jio, Tukzer dongle for internet).\", 'Speed and smooth touch, with the classy keyboard.\\nGood exp of operating for 10hrs.\\nOnly observation is no manual inside box, no further info on Googling', 'Only problem with the laptop is the fingerprint stain on the body of the laptop else everything is excellent.', 'Product is Good.\\nLight Weight\\nFast processing\\nBut only flaw we noticed is heating problem', 'Received the Order before the actual date and happy about it.

Tried all the software and driver reinstallation instructions available online with no success. Tried contacting the customer care number and got a message that the number or service doesn't exist. Called the local customer service point listed in Fujitsu site. Even that number is fake or incorrect. Looks like it is a scam. Product quality is pathetic. Speaker sounds like the one we get in local chor bazars. Kindly note that return and refund option is not available. You might get the same sub par product as a replacement even if you raise a complaint. Kindly avoid this product at any cost. I just lost around 90k of my hard earned money on this scam.\\n\\nUpdate on 9th Nov 2021\\nAfter a long conversation with Amazon support agent, I was able to connect to the support number published by Fujitsu. Looks like the message we hear when the line is busy is misleading. Once the call got through to Fujitsu support, things were pretty smooth. Support is handled by Lenovo India support team and the response was superb. The service personnel patiently attended to all the issues. Some driver updates here and there resolved the issue for a while. It reappeared again after a week. But luckily by that time Windows 11 update became available for the model. I upgraded successfully to Windows 11 and both Wifi and Bluetooth is working now. But not sure if the issue will pop up again after a while. Fingers crossed.\", 'Play Video\\n Help please.\\nI am not gettibg this ( yahoo mail) on full screen\\nRight click does not operate', 'Everything is good but its only 1.9GHZ not as mentioned in description 3.9GHZ overall budget best product best specs all rounder, perfomance is absolutely good, it came with ms office, getting i7 at this price is great deal', \"Writing this review after using it for 2 months. I would say, the laptop is just perfect for the price. All I was looking for was an i7 thing with a basic but robust graphics.\\n\\ni7 10th gen kills all the previous gen CPUs specially when clubbed with Intel Iris GPU. The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX. Its like playing on a GT 750 which is still better than not having a GPU in this chip shortage.\\n\\nIt comes with Intel NVMe which is almost twice faster than ordinary SSDs. Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time.

Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.\\n\\nLow sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.\", \"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine\\n\\n2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate\\n\\n3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy\\n\\n4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD & i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)\\n\\n5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices\\n\\n6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)\\n\\n2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key\\n\\n3.

Here is my full review after 15 days :-\\n\\n1) This is the Redmibook Pro 15 launched in China in February 2021. That sold for 4999 yuan= Rs 57800. So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges. Last year notebook was not launched in China and was India Exclusive. It always helps in Quality if the Laptop is launched in china first then comes to India. The build quality is super premium with Aluminium. Reminds of 2015 Grey Macbook pro. My old Hp laptop costing more than this was all plastic. Also its hinge broke down in just 3 years. You can open this Ultrabook with a single finger. So its hinge is robust.\\n\\n2)Touchpad though good has a little hollow sound in the left portion which feels cheap. Webcamera is average but usable for video calls. Keyboard keys gives little less resistance than my previous Hp laptop. Backlight is ok.\\n\\n3) Unlike the complaints about the speaker, it is very much audible if you keep the notebook on a hard surface with DTS audio set to game mode and equaliser maximised. My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers. Sound from headphone jack is Good.\\n\\n4) Internal components- 8/16gb Samsung Ram dual channel(3200 Mhz) , SSD- YMTC M.2 2280 (NVME)(Yangtze Memory company under Zhitai branding, China\\'s own)(thought Xiaomi had cheaped out here, but this ssd outperforms Kioxia, Micron and Hynix SSDs and is at par with Samsung(see CrystalMark disk test screenshot) though its performance in Write speeds is erratic. The CPU is H series i5 which is better than G series processor, though is less power efficient.( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).\\n\\n5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C . Rest all the time the Notebook remains cool with good thermals. The fan is noiseless(2 modes balanced+ silent) and thermals are well managed except while playing high end games/ using heavy softwares like Cinebench and while charging with poor ventilation\\n\\n6) The screen is Beautiful. You can play Netflix compatible shows in HDR and Dolby Atmos( Extraction or Kota Factory 2.0). The 90Hz refresh rate though looks gimmicky.\\n\\n7) Battery lasts 6 hours on normal usage. You can make it last more by turning down the Display resolution and refresh rate. The charging time while using the notebook can be 1.5-2 hours. The charging brick gets warm but if you keep it on bed it will get hot. Nothing alarming but. While running Microsoft Teams with charging, the left side of the laptop did get warm.\\n\\n8) Preferred it over Realmebook due to Matte display, 16gb variant plus more Ports and that higher resolution 15.6 inch screen with 90 hz refresh rate.\\n\\n9) The laptop is imported and is made in China at a place (Nanchang) which also makes Acer Laptops. Lenovo is also a client of it.\\n\\n10) You can charge the laptop through both usb c and thunderbolt ports.\\n\\n11) Xiaomi did a wise thing by not including the Nvidia Mx 450 graphic card in Indian variants. This notebook contains a single fan which is not capable of cooling down intel cpu+ nvidia gpu. The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously. Seeing the number of people complaining about the laptop did make me skeptical on buying this which itself is a tough process. The reviews of Realmebook on Flipkart do not complaint about the Quality issues which are present here.\\n\\n2) I think Xiaomi jumped the gun to announce the Notebook to eat into Realmebook\\'s sales without stocking enough units. That is why the stock problems exists in Mi Notebook while realmebook has ample stocks.\\n\\n3)Would have preferred a smaller mobile phone like universal charger or Mi sonic 67 watt charger of xiaomi. The given charger is 3rd party and the type c cable provided is a little thin to my liking. Hope Xiaomi announces a 65 watt universal charger for this like the Realmebook has.\\n\\n4) Backlight bleeding:- Yes it exists but is visible only in a pitch dark room at 40% brightness. Those who work in pitch dark rooms with black backgrounds may face problems. For every other general user it is a non issue.\\n\\n5) Amazon delivery can be problematic :- Had to order the notebook a 2nd time after Amazon cancelled my 1st order on its own a day before delivery(even after the item reached my delivery hub) citing reason as \"Item Undeliverable\". No \"Fragile\" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the \"Contains battery\" warning.\\n\\nA Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop. Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.\\n\\nTrust me other laptop companies are charging a lot more for similar specs and this also includes all plastic made laptops.(went through all of them at their exclusive stores in last 3 months before settling for this). Longevity and After sales of Xiaomi is a different topic altogether.\\n\\nDonot compare it with Macbook M1(even the i7 variant). If you have the money, go for M1 blindly. Apple is still way ahead of All windows laptops. For Windows, this is a great option with promised Windows 11 update.\\n\\nAll questions are welcome.', \"ohk so first of all.\\npros:-\\n1.great display\\n2.keyboard is very tactile and nice\\n3.finger print scanner is just awesome\\n4: overall no performance issues\\n5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.\\n1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops 😂. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop 😂.\\n\\n(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)\\nyou also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.\\n\\ncons:-\\n1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.\\n2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.\\n3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.\\n4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.\\n\\nohk so that was all form my side\", 'Everything is fine i doesn\\'t like 3 things in it they are\\n1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.\\n2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.\\n3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named \"LITEON\" Brand.\\n\\nRest of that everything is fine', \"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol. Another example after the iPhone 11 that proves higher resolution != better display.\\n\\nI have an old hp pavilion 14 x360 (14inch 1080p), LG 22MK600M monitor (22 inch IPS LCD 1080p), Lenovo L24i-30 monitor (24 inch IPS LCD 1080p) to compare with and have to say color reproduction is not at all natural on the Mi laptop. And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).\\n\\nHowever everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch.

The GPU is not to be misunderstood with UHD since its 100x times better than that but of course, still doesn't stand near GTX 1050, forget about RTX. Its like playing on a GT 750 which is still better than not having a GPU in this chip shortage.\\n\\nIt comes with Intel NVMe which is almost twice faster than ordinary SSDs. Well for my purpose (Qt Creator, KDEnLive and Android Studio), even ordinary SSD will fit but this NVMe makes processing much faster.\\nSpeakers are not so good but okay.\\n\\nThe only cons is the Camera. NOTE: if you are buying this laptop for conferencing using in built camera, avoid it. You can't even differentiate between your face and your siblings' face in this camera, the quality is that poor. Thanks to Asus Camera share, you can use your smartphone camera as an external camera which integrates perfectly with the system, Windows Camera app, Zoom and Google Meet (didn't check for MS Teams).\\n\\nMy last laptop was a Lenovo Thinkpad. For people not aware of its keyboard, they are rated among the finest keyboard designs ever produced (by IBM). After using this laptop, I am not at all missing the old good since it has that same soft touch. The only thing I am worried about is that the keyboard is soldered on motherboard so if it goes out of warranty, it would be really expensive to replace it.\\n\\nAnother downside is battery backup. Though Microsoft Surface delivers over 12 hours of usage using same CPU, this thing dies in 4 hours. Yeah but its half the price so can't compare the two seriously.\\n\\nOverall a great buy if you are not heavy gamer.\", 'I have been using ASUS laptops in the past and it is third one I purchased this time.

The tax diffrences are not that big to create such a price difference but unfortunately most of the companies use this tactics in India.\\n\\nHowever, coming to the laptop, this one of the best that I have experienced so far. I have dell, macbook, and Asus laptops in my family and I can certainly say that Dell has the best built among the all. However, LG has also done an incredibly great job with this laptop. I hoped that they could have provided a metal finishing aroud the screen as well. Rest all the things are fine.\\n\\nObviously, the specs are already mentioned, so I won't mention again. However note that the 17 inch screen is 16:10. And it is a 2k display. Based on the two, 80Wh battery gives around 8-10 hours of battery life with internet surfing and general work which is good considering screen size and resolution. You may lower the resolution to get better battery life but I did not like it after lowering the resolution and so kept it like that.\\n\\nAlso, the Ram and SSD are upgradable. I bought the 512/8 GB version. I upgraded to 1TB/16GB. NVMe SSD is supported. And Sodimm ram is supported. Ram is CL22 at 3200 MHz. So, I did not face any issues in performance either with 8 GB ram or 16 GB ram.\\n\\nGames are not playable as it does not have graphics card. However, I could still play some old games like Prototype 2 and Prince of Persia the two thrones.\\n\\nIt is mostly targeted for business users as most of the daily tasks can be done and is ultra portable.

It sometimes heats up during charging but not while using. Yes, it heats up during gaming as well but I'm personally not concerned about gaming as I didn't buy it for gaming. Though, if you are planning to buy a laptop for gaming,it is better to go for something with graphics card.\\n\\nCon - The only major con I found was that this has the trackpad in the middle with a full keyboard which makes typing difficult. The trackpad is usually placed below the space bar. However, once you start using it, you'll get used to it after a few days. It took me almost a month to get used to the key position and the backspace especially because my last laptop had only alphabetical keys. LG could have improved that by placing the alphabetical keyboard with speakers on the side. Numeric keys might be useful for number crunchers.\\n\\nOverall, I really liked the laptop, the build quality and screen is amazing to look at.\", \"I got it at 82990 , mainly for media consumption purpose , for that is perfect.\\nIt gets little bit heated at bottom.

I am a Mac User, but wanted to test this laptop to use occasionally for Windows Specific applications.\\n\\nKeyboard is large and masculine with lot of space.\\nDisplay at 2.5K is vivid, clear and stunningly beautiful (comparable to many 4k displays)\\nVery quiet and cool operation. It gets a bit warm when charging. It fairly charges pretty quickly.\\n\\nApple, Dell, HP, Acer and Lenovo should learn couple of lessons:\\nA) How to make laptop so light yet offer 10-15 hours of continuous battery\\nB) How to make laptop so quiet and offer stunningly beautiful display\\n\\nGreat buy for those who want to use for entertainment, edutainment and regular office job. Have not tested it for graphics using power hungry adobe applications.\\n\\nDid not test if the keyboard can be used in the night using backlit function.\\n\\nRecommendations.\\nA) In the future offer 4K display with graphics\\nB) Offer models in 14\" as well for top executives to use this\\nC) Offer keyboards a bit smaller without additional Keyboard Number Pad\\nD) Improve sound quality for complete entertainment purpose\\nE) Offer high resolution camera\\nF) Slightly improve aesthetics', \"Earlier I was thinking of getting the 11th gen version but its coming with LPDDR5 so the RAM won't be upgradable.\\nScreen is awesome but its a glossy one so it may be an issue if you work outdoor a lot.\\nSound is good, could be improved. There is a bit of distortion at high volume.\\nNot a glass Trackpad but its pretty smooth.\\nIf you're using it for browsing, documents, light games, etc it works fine without any issue. Starts lagging a bit if you do heavy graphic tasks or large video editing. It kinda starts giving up(but hey it wasn't meant for those tasks either)\\nI was looking for a light &slim laptop with a nice display& good performance. This one ticks all of them and that too at a fair price.\\nAsus, acer do have light ones but they come with small screen and are expensive.\\n\\nGRAB IT WHILE YOU CAN!!!!\\nIt is worth every penny spent.\", 'Cant ask for more. A handfull of laptop. Simply the best laptop computer I have used so far. Battery does not last as advertised. But I get a decent 10 plus hours backup. In the last one week, I charged it only twice. Screen is a very big plus. Very clear and nice display. I reduce the resolution to use my engineering drawings and bring it back to recommended setting after my work is done. We need to wait for all apps to catchup with this resolution. Keyboard and touchpad are fluid. Fingerprint is a breeze. Some bloatware found. I uninstalled some and kept some that that I felt is of use. Speakers are quite good. I read reviews and saw videos and was waiting for a disastrous sound. But the sound is quite good. Most importantly, we can hear a full surround sound from these two speakers. The spacing is such that it feels like listening through headphones due to the size of the laptop.\\n\\nI own many LG products, (refrigerator, washing machine, dishwasher) and now this laptop. No brand loyalty at all. But I do a research of the quality before buying, and end up buying an LG product. (My TV is a different brand)\\n\\nI believe the 2021 model is even better.', \"First of all I am using this as my primary laptop for my work for the last 5 days. Let me try to give a detailsed review from what I see.\\n\\nPros:\\n* Didn't expect the machine to be this light. Light as feather.\\n* Man, the screen quality is awesome (yes it ia reflective) but considering the quality its great.\\n* Keypad is cool amd is backlit\\n* Has two Thunderbolt ports acts based on the input - Charging, Data transfer, LAN, etc....\\n* The screen is not wobbling as others described and is sturdy (no worries if fan is on)\\n* Neat and premium finish\\n* Fingerprint is just awesome. Works better than my thinkpad and faster recognition\\n\\nCons:\\n* The charger could have been smaller but not a complaint\\n* Speakers are good and decent - not for someone who is looking for very high volume (not a con for me)\\n* Battery seems to be claiming 14 hours + but for me works for 7 hours roughly but that's still high and have to explore power saving options. (will update the review if there is any change)\\n\\nFor someone like me who works on numerous servers everyday this is a power packed machine which definitely meets my expectations. This is a great upgrade from Thinkpad. Don't think twice - grab this beauty and you wont regret at all.\", 'Single hand open is the best!!\\nLarge screen with Quality sound!\\nThe best laptop is you are a light user, strongly suggested for Manager or any Business persons who were mostly in between calls.\\nNot for gamers\\nNot for Software engineers.', 'I didnt know that LG also makes laptop. When I saw they are making 17\" laptops for a decent price I decided to give it a try.\\n1. Its super light weight, lighter than MacBook pro. It was a great surprise.\\n2. Its also very thin making it very easy to handle.\\n3. It has full keyboard which is a great plus but the layout is bit inconvenient and takes time to adjust\\n4. The speaker are located at the bottom and dont sound that great, if you want a laptop for playing music/movies dont depend on these speakers.\\n5.The internals are good, the speed is fine, I haven\\'t tested it with a 3D software or Video editing software yet, so dont know how it will perform.\\n6. The default memory is 8G and you cant upgrade/customize it on amazon while buying it, you have to buy it from a 3rd party source which is a hassle.\\n7. The fingerprint login is a great, no need to use passwords anymore\\n8. Only one USB-C/Thunderbolt port, and 3 USB ports. I would have liked more USBC/Thunderbolt ports.\\n9. No ethernet port but they give your the USBC to ethernet adapter with it.\\n10. It has Intel\\'s graphics card, which is generally not as good as NVIDIA\\'s or AMD\\'s but does perform well.\\n\\nSummary : If you want a bg screen, lightweight thin laptop, this one fits the bill. the specs are decent for a general purpose laptop. I dont expect it to perform well for applications where a great performing graphics/CPU is needed.', 'Got it 4 days ago. Light weight. Be cautious while working on it by the side of a window…it may fall due to the air coming in. Audio is a little less due to positioning of the speakers beneath the base. Performance is ok.', 'its been a week, the laptop works fine, as mentioned is super light, even compared to 14/13\" laptop, but thats why it is flimsy, you will have to be careful plugging charging cable or usb into its ports.\\n\\nwho should buy it ? below are uniq features you will not find together in any laptop.\\nif you like big screen, QHD(dont want 4k on laptop) and 16:10, my first req was 16:10 i hate 16:9 ratio, IPS display (IPS/glossy screen you can make matte by putting a film but a matte screen you cant change)\\n\\nthunderbolt port with display and power delivery func.\\n\\ngood battery backup with i7 processor\\n\\nbasic IRIS graphics processor so that HQ videos dont lag or basic gaming dont lag (ideally i would have like nvidia MX series)\\n\\nnow lets see how far the hardware lasts, i am first tie buyer of LG laptop, i mean who buys LG laptop, lenovo and asus are much better hardware makers, but sadly they dont consider a small market for buyers like me.', \"Very good & light laptop ,\\nscreen quality is good can be better for black and dark image. I saw my reflection if screen having black and dark image.\\nNice battery backup, it's work more than 8 hrs on regular use.\\nNeed to improve keyboard size and keyboard button quality.\\nNo heat issue.\\nMay be need to add fast charger.\\nHello face not supported.\\nOverall Value for money.\", \"Seems little pricey, but it is justified well with screen size, resolution and weight.\\n4 stars cause screen is wobbly, moves even with wind of ceiling fan easily. Screen panel is too flexible. Can easily pressed with slight pressure. That I feel like a concerning thing.\\nWindows 10 home I upgraded to pro cause on 2nd day of use it started giving me hang problem.\\nSpeaker is really disappointing. Very low sound. In daily noise it is not really helpful, definitely need to use headphones. Cannot be used for calls in little noisy environment.\\n\\nProduct is primarily for those who want sturdy looks with slim design, who are fan of screen size and resolution.\\n\\nLG still have a log to go related to software related things than dell or hp.\\n\\nOverall product is good. But with almost same price you can get gaming laptop with graphics card but a smaller screen size but other configurations almost same.\\n\\nEdit-\\nOnsite service unavailable if service centre of LG in your city doesn't provide laptop service.\\nI love in Aurangabad Maharashtra, but LG now asking me to Visit Pune to get service.\\nThey don't send out tech to non serviceable cities.\", 'Writing this review after 3 months use. Overall a good machine with top notch configuration. Screen quality is excellent. It’s strong though light in weight. Only problem i feel odd is easy finger prints on body and lack of physical shutter to camera', 'Good laptop with a great look and all needfull specs..only one thing is the price ..felt a bit expensive.', 'only wait less but quality normal', 'Average at this price . Thermals are very very poor even for normal task. Audio is terrible.
